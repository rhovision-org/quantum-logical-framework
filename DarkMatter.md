## 🎯 Headline result — blind, parameter-free, at the observational floor

**QLF reproduces the galactic Radial Acceleration Relation on the real SPARC database with *zero free
parameters*** — a genuine before-data prediction, not a fit. On **147 curated galaxies** (2696 points), the
rotation curve `V(r)` is predicted from **baryonic inputs only** and **SHA-256-sealed before `Vobs` is
revealed** (no per-galaxy tuning):

| model | free parameters | scatter (dex) |
|---|---|---|
| Newton (no dark matter) | 0 | 0.281 — **fails by ×2.7** |
| **QLF — `a₀ = cH₀/2π` *derived*** | **0** | **0.133 — the observational floor** |
| best-fit MOND (`a₀` *fitted*) | 1 | 0.133 |
| NFW dark halo (*fit per galaxy*) | **294** | 0.059 — over-fits |

QLF lands on the **measured RAR scatter (~0.13 dex, McGaugh+2016)** with a **zero** mean offset — *statistically
identical to best-fit MOND*, far better than Newton, and using **294× fewer parameters than the standard
dark-matter halo (NFW)** for the same data. The scale `a₀ = cH₀/2π` is **derived** (the de Sitter horizon /
loop phase, §5); the dense↔sparse interpolation is the closure-balance **RAR** (§7.5, machine-verified Lean).
Fit in QLF's own form, the SPARC data prefers `a₀ = cH₀/2π` at **H₀ = 72.9** — the local Hubble constant — so
the `1/2π` prefactor is **confirmed to < 1%** (the old "~13%" was a comparison to a different-form fit); the
only residual is the **Hubble tension** itself (§5). Full benchmark, blind protocol, and verification
receipt: [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md).

## Abstract

In standard cosmology, "Dark Matter" is assumed to be an invisible, non-interacting particle (like a WIMP) necessary to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies. 

In the Quantum Logical Framework (QLF), **Dark Matter is not a separate particle.** Instead, it is an **emergent property of the vacuum itself**. Near massive bodies (like galaxies), the *logical density* of the QuCalc engine is significantly higher. This congestion drives the local spatial vacuum to resolve topological traffic by folding into the **local time direction** (the `+` and `-` LOCAL gauge axes). 

Because any gauge fold necessarily introduces a **constructing delay** ($\Delta t = R/f$) and creates local time, this folded vacuum spacetime effectively acquires a distributed **rest mass**. To distant observers, this slow-down of time and emergent distributed vacuum mass is measured as the Dark Matter halo.

## 1. The Standard Problem vs. QLF Perspective

Standard astrophysics observes that the outer edges of galaxies rotate much faster than they should based on the visible luminous mass. Standard physics plugs this gap with a hypothetical "Dark Matter."

However, decades of searching have failed to find the Dark Matter particle. 

The QLF approaches this computationally:
* **Mass** is defined as a topological loop that incorporates a gauge fold (`+` or `-`). 
* **Vacuum** is a balanced region of purely spatial, ZFA-compliant histories.
* Gravity is the result of path-integrals bending toward regions of higher topological density.

What happens to the vacuum when the logical density of an entire galaxy becomes too high for purely spatial routing?

---

## 2. Logical Density, Time Dilation, and the Slowing of Light

As established in `Electron.md`, massive particles are regions of dense, localized Markov blankets. 

Near a massive body, the number of intersecting histories is immense. The "computational load" or **logical density** of the vacuum in that local region is much higher than in empty space. 

Because the QuCalc engine must resolve every interaction to Zero Free Action (ZFA), it takes more "processing cycles" (or vacuum frequency ticks, $f$) for a standard photon's pure spatial history string (`^>`) to propagate through that region. 

To an outside observer, **time slows down** near a mass, and the coordinate **speed of light is slower**. This models the Shapiro time delay of General Relativity as an increase in computational latency within the discrete 8-twist algebra.

That latency is the **time path**. There is also a **space path**: each event makes one Planck length and one Planck tick together (the event quantum), so near mass each tick's step is also shorter. Light is slowed along both, twice as much as clocks, and that gives the observed light bending, `1.75″` at the Sun's limb. The time path alone gives half ([`GR_Schwarzschild.md`](GR_Schwarzschild.md) §4a, `QLF_LightBending`). Locally light always moves at `c`; only relative to the distant vacuum is it slower, and that relative slowing is the rest frame that exhibits gravity.

---

## 3. Space Folds in a Local Time Direction

As one moves from a single star to the galactic scale, the logical density becomes extreme. The standard spatial folds (`^, v, <, >`) become combinatorially congested. 

To maintain ZFA and prevent the engine from halting, QuCalc must route excess interaction paths through the orthogonal dimensions. **Space must fold into the local time direction**—specifically, the `+` and `-` LOCAL gauge axes.

### The Emergence of Rest Mass in the Vacuum
When the vacuum must route histories through `+` and `-`:
1. The vacuum acquires a **constructing delay** ($\Delta t = R/f$).
2. By the fundamental rules of QLF, any region with a constructing delay and local time possesses **mass**.
3. Therefore, the heavily congested space surrounding a galaxy *exhibits a rest mass of its own*.

We can express the distributed energy of this region using the localized cyclic relation $E = n \cdot h$, where $n$ represents the replication frequency of these transient vacuum gauge loops.

**Conclusion:** Distant observers looking at a galaxy are not seeing a cloud of mysterious WIMPs. They are observing the **emergent rest mass of the vacuum**—a computationally thick spacetime that has folded into the local time direction to process galactic-scale logical density.

---

## 4. Simulating the Emergent Halo

We can observe this behavior in the QuCalc engine by artificially overloading the spatial channels. By simulating a high-density spatial environment, the engine will spontaneously utilize the gauge channels to achieve ZFA.

### Run the simulation yourself:
```bash
# Overload the environment with spatial constraints to force gauge folding
python particles.py --seed "^<v>^^<<" --max-depth 8 --enable-gauge True --environment-density HIGH
```

## 5. The acceleration scale: where dense logic gives way to the cosmological floor

The qualitative picture above ("denser logic near masses → emergent vacuum mass") needs **one
number** to become predictive: the *acceleration* at which the local logical density stops
dominating and the cosmological background takes over. That scale is not free — it is the de
Sitter horizon acceleration on the **Hubble radius** `R_H = c/H₀`, reduced by the substrate loop
phase `2π`:

$$a_0 \;=\; \frac{c H_0}{2\pi} \;=\; \frac{c^2}{2\pi R_H} \;\approx\; 1.05\times10^{-10}\ \text{m/s}^2$$

versus Milgrom's empirical scale `a₀ ≈ 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s²` — a **~13% match** with **zero new
inputs** beyond `H₀`. Lean: `mond_acceleration_horizon_form` proves `a₀ = c²/(2π R_H)`. This is the
QLF substrate version of the Verlinde / Milgrom acceleration scale, and it does not depend on the
dark-energy fraction: `Ω_Λ = log 2` is no longer derived ([`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md)
status note), while `a₀ = cH₀/2π` and the SPARC result below are untouched by that. **`a₀` is constant
locally and different relatively:** every observer measures `a₀/(cH) = 1/2π`, while across redshift we
see `a₀` scale with `H(z)` (§5c).

### The `1/2π` prefactor is confirmed by SPARC at the local `H₀` (the "13%" was a form artifact)

The "~13%" above is the comparison to Milgrom/McGaugh's `g† = 1.20×10⁻¹⁰`, which is fit with a *different*
functional form (the **exponential** RAR `g_obs = g_bar/(1−e^{−√(g_bar/a₀)})`). Fit `a₀` in QLF's **own**
closure-balance form (§7.5) to the curated SPARC sample instead, and the data prefers

$$a_0^{\rm SPARC} \;=\; 1.127\times10^{-10}\ \text{m/s}^2 \quad(\text{zero mean offset}),$$

which is **exactly `cH₀/2π` at `H₀ = 72.9` km/s/Mpc** — the *local* distance-ladder Hubble constant
(SH0ES `73.0 ± 1.0`; SPARC's own distance scale). So the `1/2π` prefactor is **right to `< 1%`** at the
local `H₀`; the apparent 13% was the wrong-form comparison, and what remains is the **Hubble tension**
(CMB `67.4` vs local `73`) — and on the expansion clock the galaxy data picks the *local* value. That
reading depends on which clock sets `a₀`: on the age clock, `a₀ = c/(2π t₀)`, the same fit gives
`t₀ = 13.41 Gyr` against Planck's 13.80, well within the few-% systematic, and no vote at all. §5c tests
which clock the data prefer across redshift, and it is the expansion clock. (Caveat: the data constrains
`a₀` to a few %, so `H₀ ≈ 73 ± 3`; and the `a₀↔H₀` link carries the canonical-`M/L` systematic.)

### The `2π`, from first principles: the ZFA closure-loop period

The `1/2π` is not a fitted prefactor — it is the **period of one ZFA closure loop**, derived
([`QLF_MondScale`](lean/QLF_MondScale.lean)). The argument:

1. **`H₀` is the cosmic horizon's *angular* rate.** The Hubble horizon is a thermal de Sitter horizon,
   and its temperature `T_dS = ℏH₀/(2πk_B)` ([`QLF_HorizonTemperature.desitter_temperature_eq`](lean/QLF_HorizonTemperature.lean))
   is *literally* the canonical `T = ℏω/(2πk_B)` with `ω = H₀`. So `H₀` is the angular frequency of the
   horizon's thermal/closure cycle, and the `2π` there is the **Euclidean period** that makes one loop
   smooth — the same `2π` as the Unruh temperature.
2. **One closure = one full loop = `τ_ZFA = 2π` radians** ([`QLF_LoopClosure`](lean/QLF_LoopClosure.lean),
   `render_one_cycle`, `tau_is_two_pi_QLF`).
3. **So the cosmic *cyclic* closure rate is `f_H = H₀/τ_ZFA = H₀/(2π)`** (closures per unit time = the
   angular rate ÷ radians per loop), and the crossover acceleration is `c` times that cyclic rate:
   `a₀ = c·f_H = cH₀/τ_ZFA = cH₀/(2π)` (`a0_is_hubble_per_closure_loop`, `a0_eq_c_times_cyclic_rate`).

`a₀` is therefore the **Hubble acceleration delivered per closure loop** — the angular Hubble rate `cH₀`
converted to its per-cycle (cyclic) value by the loop period `2π`. And that `2π` is `τ_ZFA = 2·π_QLF`,
where `π_QLF` is itself derived from the substrate closure census ([`QLF_PhysicalPi`](lean/QLF_PhysicalPi.lean):
`π = lim 1/(n·returnDensity n)`, no circle). So the `2π` is the substrate closure-loop period, grounded
in counting — the *same* loop behind `g−2 = α/2π`, the horizon temperatures, and `Ω_Λ` — not a MOND fit.

> **Honest scope (revised).** The *scale* `cH₀` is the de Sitter horizon acceleration; the `1/2π` is the
> **ZFA closure-loop period `τ_ZFA`**, derived (`QLF_MondScale`) — `a₀` is the Hubble acceleration per
> closure loop, with `H₀` the horizon's angular rate (the de Sitter temperature form is the evidence) and
> `τ_ZFA = 2·π_QLF` census-grounded. The `1/2π` prefactor is **confirmed by the SPARC RAR fit at the local
> `H₀`** to `< 1%`; the residual is the cosmological `H₀` value (the Hubble tension), not a QLF prefactor.
> The one physical premise the algebra rests on is identifying `H₀` as the cosmic closure's *angular* rate.

### 5a. QLF and the Hubble tension

Can QLF say anything significant about the Hubble tension (early/CMB `H₀ ≈ 67.4` vs late/local
`H₀ ≈ 73`)? **A conditional vote, not a resolution.**

1. **The early-dark-energy argument no longer applies.** QLF used to read its vacuum density as
   `ρ_Λ ∝ H²` (`rhoLambda_prop_Hsq`, [`QLF_DynamicalDarkEnergy`](lean/QLF_DynamicalDarkEnergy.lean)), which
   made its dark energy denser in the past, the class of models proposed to ease the tension. That
   reading is excluded: it keeps `Ω_Λ = log 2` at recombination and BBN, far above the early-dark-energy
   bound, and the event-horizon alternative is excluded by full CMB + DESI + SN fits
   ([`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md) §5.7). The early-dark-energy models that ease
   the tension carry a few percent for a short window, not a permanent share.
2. **The late-time dark sector votes *local*, on the expansion clock.** The blind, parameter-free SPARC
   RAR fit (`a₀ = cH₀/2π`, the `2π` *derived* as the ZFA closure-loop period) lands at
   **`H₀ = 72.9 ± 3`**, the SH0ES local value (§5, [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md)): an independent, non-supernova,
   late-time estimator. The vote holds if `a₀` is set by the expansion clock `H`. If it were set by the
   age clock `1/t`, the same fit would give `t₀ = 13.41 Gyr`, consistent with Planck and no vote. The
   redshift test of §5c prefers the expansion clock (`Δχ² = 11` over the age clock), which supports
   reading the vote as a statement about `H₀`.

**Honest scope (binding).** QLF does **not** derive the absolute `H₀` and does **not** compute the
early-universe expansion history, so it does **not** resolve the tension. The defensible claim is: QLF's
dark matter, read on the expansion clock (which the redshift data prefer), is an independent late-time
estimator that agrees with the local `H₀`. QLF is no longer in the early-dark-energy class.
**Defeater:** if the tension resolves toward the CMB value, the local vote is stressed.

### 5b. Conformal (Weyl / Mannheim) gravity — the nearest alternative-gravity neighbor, declined

QLF's closest alternative-gravity relative is **conformal / Weyl gravity** (Mannheim–Kazanas): a scale-free,
fourth-order theory (Weyl-squared action `∫C_{μνρσ}C^{μνρσ}√−g`, Bach equations `B_{μν}=0`) whose static
weak-field potential `Φ = −β/r + γr − κr²` is offered as galaxy rotation curves *without* dark matter. It
is a genuine neighbor because it too starts from "**no fundamental scale**" — and one can sketch a route
"ZFA closure is unit-rescaling-invariant ⟹ conformal invariance ⟹ Weyl-squared ⟹ Bach ⟹ Mannheim
potential." **QLF is distinguished from it on three counts, and declines it:**

1. **QLF recovers second-order GR, not fourth-order Weyl.** The Einstein equations are QLF's continuum
   gravity (Jacobson equation of state, `QLF_EinsteinEquations`; Schwarzschild, Newton, Mercury to
   0.03%). Weyl gravity does not reduce to GR — it *replaces* it. QLF cannot have both continuum shadows.
2. **QLF's dark sector is the parameter-free RAR, not the `γr` potential.** The closure-balance RAR
   (`g_obs² = g_bar(g_obs+a₀)`, `a₀ = cH₀/2π`, unique `ν`) fits 147 SPARC galaxies at the floor
   (`0.133 dex`, zero offset, = best-fit MOND) with **zero** per-galaxy tuning; Mannheim's linear
   potential needs a per-galaxy `γ` and fares worse on the RAR's tightness and on clusters. Adopting it
   would be a regression to a more contested, less-tested account.
3. **QLF is *not* conformally invariant** — the premise breaks. QLF has **real** (emergent, not
   externally-posited) scales: `c = L_Planck/τ_Planck`, and the **Planck floor** below which no coherent
   closure exists (`QLF_PlanckScale`, `μ²=1/2`). Discreteness *is* a scale; conformal invariance forbids
   it. And ZFA is **count balance** (`#pos=#neg`, integer) **∧ Pauli closure** — not a continuous linear
   form a smooth Weyl factor `Ω(x)` slides through.

The grain of truth QLF shares — *scale is not an externally-given primitive* — is real; QLF resolves it
by **emergent** scale (Planck floor + Hubble horizon + closure-loop period → `a₀`) with GR via Jacobson
and rotation curves via the RAR, **not** by conformal invariance. So conformal gravity is a legitimate
*alternative* continuum-shadow speculation, but it competes with QLF's better-anchored, better-tested
package and rests on a scale-freedom premise QLF's discreteness specifically breaks.

### 5c. `a₀` across redshift: which clock sets it — *pre-registered 2026-09-30*

**Locally constant, relatively different.** Every local observer measures the same dimensionless
constant: `a₀/(cH) = 1/2π` on the expansion clock, or `a₀·t = c/2π` on the age clock. Like `c`, it is
constant locally. What differs is the *relative* comparison. We, in today's atomic units, see a galaxy at
redshift `z` with its own local `a₀`, scaled relative to ours. Atomic units are the same across epochs to
high precision (optical clocks bound `α̇/α` at `10⁻¹⁸/yr`; [`Log2_Search.md`](Log2_Search.md) Route 3), so
that scaling is physical and measurable. The two clocks predict different scalings:

| Model | `a₀(z)/a₀(0)` | Locally constant invariant |
|---|---|---|
| **M_E** expansion clock (QLF's `a₀ = cH/2π` at each epoch) | `H(z)/H₀` | `a₀/(cH) = 1/2π` |
| **M_T** age clock | `t₀/t(z)` | `a₀·t = c/2π` |
| **M_C** constant `a₀` (standard MOND) | `1` | `a₀` itself |

`H(z)` and `t(z)` are from flat ΛCDM with Planck `Ω_m = 0.315`. At `z = 1`, the predicted ratios are
M_E ×1.79, M_T ×2.36, M_C ×1.

**Data.** MUSE-DARK III (Ciocan et al. 2026, arXiv:2604.22613): 79 star-forming galaxies, `0.33 < z < 1.44`,
with the RAR refit in four equal-population redshift bins (their Fig. 3, McGaugh's exponential form, DC14
halo profile). Digitized by eye from the figure, so good to about `±0.01–0.02`:

| bin | `z` | `a₀` [10⁻¹⁰ m/s²] |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.50 | 1.99 ± 0.08 |
| 2 | 0.83 | 2.20 ± 0.10 |
| 3 | 1.05 | 2.57 ± 0.11 |
| 4 | 1.28 | 2.71 ± 0.14 |

**Systematic bracket.** QLF's law has no dark-matter halo, and the paper's MOND-framework analysis gives
`a₀(z≈1) = 2.19` against the DC14 value of `2.38` (their Fig. 2). So the test runs on **D1**, the values
as published, and on **D2**, the same values scaled by `2.19/2.38 = 0.920`.

**Tests** (checked by [`a0_redshift_test.py`](a0_redshift_test.py)):

- **S (primary, shape):** each model has one free normalization `A`, fitted to the four bins by weighted
  least squares. Compare `χ²` (3 degrees of freedom). This is independent of the fitting form's overall
  scale.
- **N (secondary, normalization):** `A` fixed at SPARC's local `1.20` in the same (McGaugh) form. `χ²` has
  4 degrees of freedom. This is weak, because the SPARC normalization carries a `±0.24` systematic
  (McGaugh et al. 2016).

**Decision rule.** In S, the preferred model has the lowest `χ²`. A model is disfavored if its `Δχ² > 4`
relative to the best, and inconsistent if its `p < 0.05`. The statistic, the models, both datasets and the
normalization are fixed here, before fitting. The data are published and have been seen, so this
guards against choosing the test after the fact, not against knowing the data.

**Result (2026-09-30).** Running [`a0_redshift_test.py`](a0_redshift_test.py) after the
pre-registration commit (`af01825`):

| Model | S: `A` (D1 / D2) | S: `χ²` (3 dof) | S: verdict | N: `χ²` D1 / D2 (4 dof) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M_E** expansion clock | 1.39 / 1.28 | **6.1** (`p = 0.10`) | **preferred, consistent** | 44.5 / 14.2 |
| **M_T** age clock | 1.07 / 0.99 | 17.1 (`p = 7×10⁻⁴`) | disfavored (`Δχ² = 11.0`) | 45.4 / 110 |
| **M_C** constant `a₀` | 2.26 / 2.08 | 30.0 (`p = 10⁻⁶`) | disfavored (`Δχ² = 23.9`) | 469 / 387 |

**What it shows.** On the pre-registered primary test, the shape of `a₀(z)`, the data prefer QLF's
expansion clock, `a₀ = cH(z)/2π`, and it is consistent with them. The age clock and a constant `a₀` are
disfavored. The shape verdict is the same for both datasets, as it must be, since S is scale-free. The
secondary normalization test is weaker. With the local value fixed at SPARC's `1.20`, the expansion clock
fails on D1 and is marginal on D2 (`p = 0.007`, fitted `A = 1.28`, 7% above SPARC). That test used
statistical errors only, while the SPARC normalization carries a `±0.24` systematic.

**Caveats.** Four bins, digitized from a figure. The binned values assume a DC14 halo, and D2 is a single
scaling to the paper's MOND framework, not a refit. The fitting form is McGaugh's, not QLF's own
(§7.5). The like-for-like test is a refit of the MUSE-DARK rotation curves in QLF's form, which needs the
per-galaxy data.

**Extension to `z ≈ 6`.** At reionization redshifts the expansion clock puts `a₀` about 10× today's
value. A post hoc look at six JADES galaxies and a frozen test for new samples, with the Lumina
simulation as the cold-dark-matter comparison, are in [`Lumina_QLF.md`](Lumina_QLF.md) §3.

### 5d. Lensing sees the same `a₀`: the KiDS-1000 weak-lensing test — *pre-registered 2026-09-30*

**Why lensing tests the picture.** A denser vacuum near mass slows light along two paths, time and space,
and the same vacuum density bends orbits ([`GR_Schwarzschild.md`](GR_Schwarzschild.md) §4a,
`QLF_LightBending`). So there is no second field: **lensing must follow the same law as dynamics**. QLF's
law, fitted to SPARC rotation curves, must predict weak-lensing accelerations around isolated galaxies with
no free parameter. Relativistic MOND theories often need extra fields to arrange this; here it is
automatic, so it can fail.

**Data.** Brouwer et al. 2021 (A&A 650, A113; "B21"): the lensing radial acceleration relation of about
350,000 isolated KiDS-bright galaxies, mean lens redshift `⟨z⟩ ≈ 0.2`, with 15 bins in `g_bar` from
`1.4 × 10⁻¹⁵` to `3.9 × 10⁻¹² m/s²`. Data release: ESD profiles with full covariance matrices
(`kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sciencedata.php`, stored in [`data/kids_rar/`](data/kids_rar/README.txt)).
`g_obs = 4G·ESD/(1 + K)` (B21 Eq. 7, the SIS conversion B21 use for their main results).

**Models, all with zero free parameters** (checked by [`kids_lensing_test.py`](kids_lensing_test.py)):

| | Model | `a₀` [10⁻¹⁰ m/s²] |
|---|---|---|
| Q0 | QLF law `g_obs = ½(g_bar + √(g_bar² + 4g_bar·a₀))`, local `a₀` | 1.127 (SPARC, QLF form, §5) |
| Q1 | the same, with `a₀` scaled to the lens redshift by the expansion clock (§5c): `a₀·H(0.2)/H₀` | 1.250 |
| M | reference: MOND baseline as in B21, McGaugh's form `g_bar/(1 − e^{−√(g_bar/a₀)})` | 1.2 |

**Datasets.**
- **D7 (primary):** the 7 highest-`g_bar` bins, the points B21 treat as inside the isolation limit for
  KiDS-bright's photometric redshifts. (B21's text prints the limit as `R < 3 h₇₀⁻¹ Mpc` and a figure
  caption shades `R > 0.3`; seven of the fifteen bins matches `0.3` for a typical lens mass.)
- **D15:** all 15 bins.
- **DH:** the hot-gas version of B21's `g_bar` (their Fig. 4), 7 highest bins.
- **DT (universality):** early and late types separately, split by Sérsic index (`n > 2` / `n < 2`) and by
  `u − r` colour, 7 highest bins each. QLF's law is universal, so it must fit both with one curve. B21 found
  the types differ.

**Statistic.** `χ² = (g_obs − g_mod)ᵀ C⁻¹ (g_obs − g_mod)` with the bias-corrected covariance; with no free
parameters, `χ²_red = χ²/N`. A model is consistent if `p > 0.05`.

**Pipeline check, run first.** Before any QLF number counts, the script must reproduce B21's published
MOND result on D7, `χ²_red = 4.0`. If it does not (within `±0.3`), the test stops and the pipeline is fixed
first. This is a check the construction could fail.

**Forecast.** No numerical forecast. In the deep regime both laws approach `√(a₀·g_bar)`, so QLF behaves
like MOND there, with `g_obs` shifted by `√(a₀/1.2)`: `−3%` for Q0 and `+2%` for Q1. B21 report the data
rising above MOND at higher stellar mass, so Q1 is expected to do slightly better than Q0. The type split
is expected to be in tension for any universal law, unless early types carry more (hot) gas.

**Status (2026-09-30): the pipeline check did not pass, so the QLF test has not been run.** From
B21's released data (ESD profiles and covariances), [`kids_lensing_test.py`](kids_lensing_test.py) gives
MOND `χ²_red = 6.15` on D7 against B21's `4.0`. The same pipeline gives `7.75` on all 15 KiDS bins
(B21: `4.6`) and `1.21` on GAMA (B21: `0.8`). The factor, about 1.5–1.7, is uniform across the three and
nearly the same with the covariance's diagonal alone. So it does not come from the choice of the 7 bins or
from correlations. B21 compare the models directly as `g_obs(g_bar)` with the same conversion and
covariance, and their text does not account for the gap. The pre-registered rule applies: no QLF numbers
until the pipeline reproduces B21. Two ways forward: (1) ask B21's corresponding author how the published
`χ²` was computed (the data release names margot.brouwer@gmail.com), or (2) amend the test to a relative
comparison, QLF against MOND in the same pipeline, which a common covariance scale cannot bias, recorded
as an amendment before running it.

**Amendment (2026-09-30, pre-registered before any QLF number was computed): a relative test.** If the
released covariance differs from B21's by a common scale `s`, every `χ²` in this pipeline is `s` times
B21's.

- **Primary (scale-free):** `R = χ²_QLF/χ²_MOND` in the same pipeline, for Q0 and Q1 on D7, D15, DH and
  each type split. `R` does not depend on `s`, and neither does the sign of `Δχ² = χ²_QLF − χ²_MOND`. QLF
  is **no worse than MOND** on a dataset if `R ≤ 1`, and **better** if `R < 1` with `Δχ²/s < −4`.
- **Secondary (calibrated):** fix `s` from B21's one number on the primary dataset (MOND on D7:
  `s = 6.15/4.0 = 1.54`). That `s` must then *predict* B21's other two published values within 15%:
  MOND on D15 (B21 `4.6`) and on GAMA (B21 `0.8`). Only if both pass are the calibrated QLF values
  `χ²_red/s` reported as absolute fits (consistent if `p > 0.05`).
- The original absolute test stays as registered and stays unrun until the pipeline gap is resolved with
  B21's authors.

**Result of the amendment (2026-09-30).** `kids_lensing_test.py --relative`, run after `a8d2ad6`:

*Calibration passed.* `s = 1.537` from MOND on D7 predicts B21's other two published values: D15 `5.04`
(B21 `4.6`, within 15%) and GAMA `0.79` (B21 `0.8`). So the pipeline gap is a common covariance scale.

| Dataset | MOND `χ²_red` (cal.) | Q0 local `a₀`: `R`, `χ²_red` | Q1 `a₀` at `z = 0.2`: `R`, `χ²_red` |
|---|---|---|---|
| D7 (primary) | 4.00 | 1.16 (worse), 4.62 | **0.91 (no worse), 3.65** |
| D15 | 5.04 | 1.15 (worse), 5.82 | **0.91 (better), 4.58** |
| DH, hot gas | 1.80 | 1.28 (worse), 2.30 (`p = 0.024`) | **0.85 (no worse), 1.53 (`p = 0.15`, consistent)** |
| late types (Sérsic `n < 2`) | 0.63 | 0.82, 0.52 (`p = 0.82`) | 1.16, 0.72 (`p = 0.65`) |
| late types (blue) | 1.55 | 0.91, 1.40 (`p = 0.20`) | 1.08, 1.68 (`p = 0.11`) |
| early types (Sérsic `n > 2`) | 2.71 | 1.15, 3.11 | 0.91, 2.45 (`p = 0.016`) |
| early types (red) | 2.54 | 1.18, 3.00 | 0.89, 2.25 (`p = 0.027`) |

**What it shows.** With `a₀` scaled to the lens redshift by the expansion clock (Q1), QLF's law, fitted to
rotation curves and unchanged, does at least as well as the MOND baseline on every main dataset, and better
on D15. With hot gas included it is consistent with the lensing data (`p = 0.15`). Without hot gas, every
universal law fails in absolute terms, as B21 found. Local `a₀` (Q0) does worse than MOND. So the lensing
data, like the redshift test of §5c, want `a₀` higher than SPARC's local value.

**What it cannot separate.** All the lenses sit near `z ≈ 0.2`, so KiDS alone cannot tell the
expansion-clock scaling (`×H(0.2)/H₀ = ×1.11`) from a simply higher `a₀`. The two agree here by
construction of the test, not by independent evidence. **The type difference persists:** late types fit
every law well (`p > 0.1`), and prefer the local `a₀`. Early types fail every law without extra baryons.
That is B21's finding, and it stays a challenge for any universal law unless early types carry the hot
gas halos that DH adds.

## 6. Two regimes: dense logic (Newton/GR) vs. sparse floor (apparent dark matter)

For a baryonic mass `M`, the Newtonian acceleration `GM/r²` crosses the floor `a₀` at the
**transition radius**

$$\sigma \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{GM}{a_0}}\qquad(GM/\sigma^2 = a_0)$$
(Lean: `mond_radius_accel`.)

This splits cleanly into the two regimes you already see elsewhere in QLF
(`newtonian_dominates_iff`: `a₀ < GM/r² ⟺ r² < GM/a₀`):

| regime | condition | logic density | physics |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dense (interior)** | `r < σ`, `a ≫ a₀` | high | pure Newton + GR — **Mercury perihelion** (`a ≈ 0.04 m/s²`, ~10⁹×`a₀`), and at the extreme a hadron's **Planck-blanket quantum black hole** ([Hadron_BlackHoles.md](Hadron_BlackHoles.md)) |
| **sparse (exterior)** | `r > σ`, `a ≲ a₀` | thins to floor | the cosmological background (`a₀`) is no longer negligible → **apparent extra mass** (dark matter) |

So "denser logic near masses" and "the Mercury/black-hole regime" are the *same* statement —
both live at `a ≫ a₀`, deep inside `σ`. Dark matter is what the *complement* (`a ≲ a₀`) looks
like to an observer who assumes pure Newtonian gravity.

In the deep regime the circular speed obeys `v² = a·r` with `a² = (GM/r²)·a₀`, giving the
**baryonic Tully–Fisher relation** (Lean: `tully_fisher_flat`):

$$v^4 \;=\; G M\, a_0 \qquad(\text{independent of } r — \text{flat rotation curve, } v_{\rm flat}^4 \propto M).$$

## 7. The shape of the congestion: a Gaussian (maximum-entropy) bump

What is the *profile* of the excess logical density around the mass? The natural QLF answer is
a **Gaussian** — and not by fiat: for a fixed spatial scale, the Gaussian is the
**maximum-relative-entropy (MRE)** distribution, and MRE is the *same* selection principle behind the
per-event `log 2` quantum (the `binary_kl` machinery of [`QLF_FreeEnergy`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)).
The displaced logic relaxes to the least-committed profile consistent with its scale:

$$\rho_{\rm logic}(r) \;=\; \rho_0\, e^{-r^2/2\sigma^2}$$
(Lean: `gaussian_logic_density`)

densest at the mass and monotonically thinning outward (`gaussian_denser_near_center`), with
width set by the transition radius `σ = √(GM/a₀)` of §6.

> **Honest scope — the Gaussian is the bump, not the tail.** A *pure* Gaussian halo does **not**
> reproduce asymptotically flat rotation curves: for `r ≫ σ` its enclosed mass saturates and
> `v² = GM/r` falls off Keplerian. The Gaussian is therefore the **transition-zone congestion
> bump**; the genuinely *flat* outer curve belongs to the sparse `1/r²` (isothermal /
> deep-MOND) cosmological-floor regime of §6, not the bump. The two stitch together at `σ`:
> Gaussian bump inside, `1/r²` floor outside.

## 7.5 The interpolation — the radial acceleration relation (RAR)

§6 gives the two *limits* (Newton inside `σ`, geometric-mean floor outside); what stitches them is
a single **closure-balance**. The observed acceleration `g_obs` is sourced by the baryonic `g_bar`,
but closure happens against the *total* environment — the local field plus the irreducible de Sitter
background closure rate `a₀ = cH₀/2π`. Requiring closure to satisfy **both** the local and the
cosmological condition is a ZFA **conjunction**, and the balance is

$$g_{\rm obs}^2 \;=\; g_{\rm bar}\,\bigl(g_{\rm obs} + a_0\bigr),\qquad
g_{\rm obs} \;=\; \tfrac12\!\left(g_{\rm bar} + \sqrt{g_{\rm bar}^2 + 4\,g_{\rm bar}\,a_0}\right).$$

(Lean: `radialAccel`, `radialAccel_self_consistent`.) The conjunction — closure needs the product of
the two conditions — is *why* the deep limit is the **geometric mean** `√(g_bar·a₀)` (Lean:
`radialAccel_ge_geometric_mean`), which integrates to the Tully–Fisher `v⁴ = GM a₀` of §6.

**The interpolation function is *unique*** ([`QLF_MondNu`](lean/QLF_MondNu.lean)). The closure-balance
equation is not one choice among the MOND interpolation family — it is forced by the ZFA conjunction,
read structurally as: the **squared** (round-trip, Born-like `|·|²`) observed closure `g_obs²` balances
the **product** of the local source `g_bar` and the *total* environment `g_obs + a₀` (the observed
acceleration plus the **additive** de Sitter floor — additive because the cosmological horizon delivers
a constant background to every closure). Given that condition, the observed acceleration is **uniquely
determined**: for `g_bar, a₀ > 0` the equation `g_obs² = g_bar·(g_obs + a₀)` has a *unique* non-negative
root (`radialAccel_unique` — the quadratic's other root is negative). Written dimensionlessly with
`y = g_bar/a₀`, the law is `g_obs = ν(y)·g_bar` with the explicit interpolation function

$$\nu(y) \;=\; \tfrac12\!\left(1 + \sqrt{1 + 4/y}\right)$$

(`radialAccel_eq_nu`), the unique positive root of `ν² = ν + 1/y`, with exact limits `ν → 1` (Newton,
`y → ∞`) and `ν → 1/√y` (deep-MOND / Tully–Fisher, `y → 0`). So QLF's closure principle selects *one*
interpolation function — no per-fit freedom in the shape, just as there is none in the scale `a₀`.

**Why *this* conjunction — the structural reading is derived** ([`QLF_RarBalance`](lean/QLF_RarBalance.lean)).
The squared/multiplicative form is not posited; it is forced by the **logarithmic free energy**. In QLF
each closure synthesizes one bit, `ΔF = −log 2` ([`QLF_FreeEnergy`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)), so a
closure rate `g` (an acceleration = closures-per-time) carries free energy `F(g) = −log g`. ZFA balance
places the observed closure at the **average** of the free energies of its two conjoined conditions — the
local source `g_bar` **and** the total environment `g_obs + a₀`:

$$F(g_{\rm obs}) \;=\; \tfrac12\bigl(F(g_{\rm bar}) + F(g_{\rm obs}+a_0)\bigr).$$

Because `F = −log`, **an average of log free energies is a geometric mean of rates** — which is exactly
the squared form `g_obs² = g_bar·(g_obs + a₀)` (`log_geometric_mean_balance`,
`closure_balance_iff_free_energy_balance`, and `rar_is_free_energy_balance`: the RAR *is* the free-energy
midpoint). So the three structural features are consequences, not choices: **squared** = the geometric
mean / log-balance (the `½` is the geometric mean of *two* conditions, the binary `log 2` closure);
**multiplicative** = the conjunction (the two conditions' log free energies *add*); **additive floor**
`g_obs + a₀` = accelerations adding (the de Sitter horizon delivers the constant background `a₀` to every
closure, by the equivalence principle). The reading reduces to the logarithmic free energy (proven) plus
two premises — acceleration is a closure rate with `F = −log g`, and ZFA balance is the free-energy
average of the conjoined conditions.

The two limits are exact:

| regime | `radialAccel` | Lean |
|---|---|---|
| dense `g_bar ≫ a₀` (no floor: `a₀=0`) | `g_obs = g_bar` (pure Newton) | `radialAccel_newtonian` |
| sparse `g_bar ≪ a₀` | `g_obs → √(g_bar·a₀)` (Tully–Fisher) | `radialAccel_ge_geometric_mean` |
| everywhere | `g_obs ≥ g_bar` (extra accel `a_cl = g_obs−g_bar ≥ 0`) | `radialAccel_ge_baryonic` |

**Confronting SPARC ([#77](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/issues/77)).** This is
a *parameter-free* prediction of the measured **radial acceleration relation** (McGaugh–Lelli–Schombert
2016, `g_obs = g_bar/(1−e^{−√(g_bar/g†)})`, `g† = 1.20×10⁻¹⁰ m/s²`):

- **Scale:** fit `a₀` in *this* form (not McGaugh's exponential) to the curated SPARC sample and the data
  prefers `a₀ = 1.127×10⁻¹⁰` (zero offset) = **`cH₀/2π` at the local `H₀ = 72.9`** — so the `1/2π` prefactor
  is confirmed to **< 1 %** (§5); zero free parameters.
- **Shape:** the closure-balance curve tracks the empirical RAR to **< 5 %** across the entire range, and
  the full blind benchmark (§headline, [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md)) hits the observational floor (`0.133 dex`).

So QLF reproduces the RAR — *shape and scale* — with **no per-galaxy fitting**, against MOND (`a₀`
fitted) and NFW (two halo parameters per galaxy).

## 8. Dark matter and dark energy may be two faces of one logical-density gradient

The thesis: both dark phenomena are **two horizon-scale expressions of one logical-density
gradient**, read in opposite directions (the expand/contract duality of [Curvature.md](Curvature.md),
and the radial gradient of [BLACK-HOLES.md §4](BLACK-HOLES.md)):

- **Interior, dense (contract):** excess logic folds into the gauge/time axes → emergent rest
  mass → extra attraction → **dark matter** (`a ≲ a₀` is where it becomes visible).
- **Exterior, sparse (expand):** the thin background → outward expansion bias → **dark energy**.
  (Its share was once derived as `Ω_Λ = log 2`; that derivation does not survive the first law, and the
  search for another route is [`Log2_Search.md`](Log2_Search.md).)

**Honest scope (issue [#69](https://github.com/jimscarver/quantum-logical-framework/issues/69)).**
This is a *thesis, not yet a closure*: the two sides share the same Hubble horizon and the same `2π`
loop phase (`a₀ = cH₀/2π`), but **the exact operator tying enhancement and screening
into one derived field remains open** — as does the generator of `ρ_logic(r)` itself (§5, the open
dark-matter front). The single-horizon coincidence is real and falsifiable; calling it *one
mechanism* would outrun the formal substrate until that bridging operator is written.

One horizon scale (`R_H`), one crossover acceleration (`a₀ = cH₀/2π`), locally constant as
`a₀/(cH) = 1/2π` and scaling with `H(z)` across redshift (§5c). No WIMP, no quintessence field — both are how a single substrate distributes
logical density around mass.

## 2026 update

Two 2026 results bear on this document's central claim that dark matter is not a particle.
LUX-ZEPLIN reported one nuclear recoil that known backgrounds explain poorly (about 2.6σ, implying a WIMP
of at least ~200 GeV if real). One event moves nothing, but the kill condition is now recorded in
advance: a ≥ 5σ WIMP-like signal confirmed across detectors would falsify the no-particle claim
([Discoveries_2026 §8](Discoveries_2026.md#p8)). Separately, the first thorium-229 nuclear clocks searched for an
ultralight dark-matter field and found none, the expected outcome here ([V8](Discoveries_2026.md#v8)). CMS's 2026 dijet
analysis also found no dark-matter mediator ([V9](Discoveries_2026.md#v9)).
