# Experimental Consistency: Proving the Possibilist Universe

**Method:** the rules this ledger is graded by — epistemic status labels, kill conditions, symmetry-lock checks, exact-arithmetic discipline — are in [`ScientificApproach.md`](ScientificApproach.md).

A valid physical framework must do more than possess mathematical elegance; it must retrodict the proven experimental results of standard quantum mechanics and general relativity, and it must do so with falsifiable quantitative tests rather than slogans.

The **Quantum Logical Framework (QLF)** proposes that the universe operates on a discrete topological logic with exactly two foundational inputs: **(1) Zero Free Action (ZFA)** — the closure principle on an 8-twist alphabet, encompassing both algebraic faces (Pauli closure on the non-abelian side, count balance / Hermitian-pair multiset on the abelian side; the variational principle `ℒ = 0` is the same closure restated); and **(2) the substrate event quantum** (each substrate event creates one Planck length and one Planck tick *together*; see [`Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md`](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.3). For (2), the *scale* follows **by construction**, not by posit: the Planck scale is the minimal coherent-closure length — the Compton–Schwarzschild self-dual floor below which a blanket cannot close ([`Planck_Scale.md`](Planck_Scale.md), [`lean/QLF_PlanckScale.lean`](lean/QLF_PlanckScale.lean)); only the SI *value in metres* (a unit convention) is a genuine input. All of physics is then derived. This document tracks which experimental retrodictions the framework has actually achieved, to what precision, and where the open work is.

For the variational foundation see [Lagrangian_Formulation.md](Lagrangian_Formulation.md). For the 8-twist completeness argument see [eight-twists-sufficiency.md](eight-twists-sufficiency.md). For the unifying spectral picture see [SpectralGap.md](SpectralGap.md).

## §1 Method

Every claim in this document carries one of three status markers:

- **Lean-verified** — a machine-verified theorem exists in the QLF Lean repo. Citations are by theorem name + file.
- **Numerically confirmed** — a Python script (`constants_mapper.py`, `hydrogen_qlf.py`, `maxwell_qlf.py`, …) produces the claimed value at a documented sample size. Citations are by script + report.
- **Open** — a derivation path is identified but not yet completed. These are listed as next steps, not asserted as results.

We avoid stating digits the code does not currently produce. Where a calibration choice is required (e.g. anchoring a mass scale to bridge SI units), it is called out explicitly as a calibration, not a fit.

The **ZFA spectrum-explorer** [`Genesis.md`](Genesis.md) (runnable as [`genesis.py`](genesis.py)) exercises several of these end-to-end with every line epistemically tagged: the exact `−p/2` census spectral exponent (now **Lean-anchored** at low orders, `QLF_CensusWalk` — `p=2` = the machine-checked π return density), census→π, the `128+d²=137` joint, and a **particle map referenced to `m_e`** (`m = 1/R = frequency`; the proton `6π⁵`, pion `2/α`, Koide-τ rows *reuse* the Lean-verified ratios below, with the measured value beside each). It **displays and reuses** verified results — not a new precision row — and states its honest negatives (the raw swap-graph dimension diverges; no discrete-scale-invariance; the α residual) at full weight.

ZFA is the conjunction of two algebraic conditions: **count balance** (signed action vector vanishes) and **Pauli closure** (matrix product folds to a scalar). Both are enforced in every reference implementation — see §2.1.

## §1.1 Summary of positive results (quick reference)

What the framework currently retrodicts, derives, or Lean-verifies. Each item is enumerated in detail later in this document; this section is a scan-table. Full bibliography in §11.

### Fundamental constants

| Constant | Value | QLF route | Precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| **α** (fine-structure) | 1/137.036 | Substrate combinatorics + leading screening: `1/128 × (1+9α)⁻¹ = 1/137.000` — the **leading value** (N=9 from 3² spatial-tensor, 3D substrate). **Lean-verified** `alpha_QLF_eq` (`QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`); the **two-sided bracket `137.01587 < α⁻¹ < 137.04813`** machine-checked both ends in `QLF_AlphaBound.lean` (`irreducibleCap_eq`, `alphaInvCap_eq`); and the leading value is a **machine-checked cross-sector overdetermination joint** (`QLF_AlphaRigidity`: the dimension sector `d=3`, the bare-coupling `128=2⁷`, and elementarity `137` prime meet with zero slack — not a fit, `d` substrate-derived). **Residual healed** ([`Alpha_Residual.md`](Alpha_Residual.md) §9b–§9g): the equal-weight prediction **`137.032` is structural** (`w = ½` forced by the free-monoid bifibration, not fitted); `0.036` is **existence-proven** (reachable by a prime resummation, strictly inside the bracket) with its **multiplicity** — which continuum resummation — the open piece = the SM's own vacuum-polarisation running. Every substrate mechanism swing closed; the one-loop `2/(3π)` is 1PI-confirmed, and the census period-content reaches through **3-loop `g−2`** (nesting depth = loop order), boundary at **4-loop QED**. So QLF suggests **~5 significant figures** of `α⁻¹` (`137.03`); the `~0.004` beyond is the SM's continuum frontier, not suggested as a number. Canonical doc [`Alpha.md`](Alpha.md) | **0.026%** leading (0.003% for `137.032`; no observable input, zero free parameters — see §6.3 Tier 3) |
| **α** (alternative) | 1/137.036 | QLF Bohr inversion of hydrogen: `α = √(2 Ry / m_e c²)` | 10⁻¹⁰ from measured Ry, m_e c² (§4 + §6.3 Tier 2) |
| **c** (speed of light) | 299 792 458 m/s | Substrate event quantum: one Planck length × one Planck tick per event | Substrate-derived (no Tier-3 open — see §3) |
| **Ry** (Rydberg) | 13.606 eV | Structural identity `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` from Coulomb-via-gauge-twist-exchange + ZFA-depth. Substrate α from `QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean` (1/137.000); **only `m_e` is empirically measured** | 0.05% from substrate α + m_e alone (§4) |
| **γ** (Euler-Mascheroni) | 0.5772156649 | Harmonic excess `H_N − ln N` over composed stable-closure ensemble. **Lean-anchored** structurally in `QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean` (`gamma_QLF_structural` + small-N theorems); numerical demonstration at 0.017% in `constants_mapper.emerge_gamma()` | 0.017% (§6.2) |
| **Ω_Λ** (dark-energy fraction) | 0.685 (Planck 2018) | Substrate prediction `Ω_Λ_QLF = log 2 ≈ 0.6931` from per-event log 2 quantum × gauge-axis fraction 2/8. **Lean-verified** as `Omega_Lambda_QLF = Real.log 2` in `QLF_CosmologicalConstant.lean`. *Substrate-derived without empirical input.* | **1.2%** (no observable input, see [`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md) §5.5) |
| **Λ** (cosmological constant) | ρ_Λ = 5.83 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³ | Substrate derivation `ρ_Λ = (3 log 2 / 8π) c⁴/(G R_H²)` from holographic event count + per-event log 2 + de Sitter horizon temp + 6+2 gauge fraction. Closes the famous "vacuum catastrophe" (10¹²² discrepancy) structurally. **Lean-verified** as `vacuum_energy_prefactor` in `QLF_CosmologicalConstant.lean` | 8.8% (`H_0` = the single residual calibration ≡ deriving the cosmic count `n`, the same input behind the age; Hubble-tension limited) |
| **a₀** + the **rotation-curve law** (dark matter) | the SPARC Radial Acceleration Relation, 147 galaxies (McGaugh/Lelli 2016) | `a₀ = cH₀/(2π) = c²/(2π R_H)` (same Hubble radius as `Ω_Λ = log 2`, `mond_acceleration_horizon_form`); the dense↔sparse **interpolation** is the closure-balance RAR `g_obs²=g_bar(g_obs+a₀)` (`radialAccel_self_consistent`, both limits exact) | **Blind SPARC benchmark** (baryonic-only, SHA-256-sealed, **parameter-free**) hits the **observational floor** `0.133 dex`, zero offset — = best-fit MOND, vs Newton (×2.7), vs NFW (294 fit params). Fit in QLF's own form the data prefers `a₀=cH₀/2π` at **H₀=72.9** (local) → `1/2π` confirmed to **<1%**; residual = the Hubble tension. [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md), [`DarkMatter.md`](DarkMatter.md) §5 |
| **Planck/proton mass hierarchy** | `ln(M_Planck/m_p) ≈ 44.01` (the 10¹⁹ hierarchy) | Dimensional transmutation collapses to a **pure integer**: `ln R_p = 2π/(b₀ α_s) = 2π·b₀ = 14π` with the substrate QCD `b₀ = 7` (= `N_c=3`, `n_f=6`, *derived*) and the **posit** `α_s = 1/b₀²` (running-consistent, ~7%). **Lean-verified** `hierarchy_log_eq_fourteen_pi` (`QLF_AlphaS.lean`), `beta_coefficient_eq_seven` (`QLF_BetaFunction.lean`) | **0.07%** on the log (`14π ≈ 43.98`) — but this is the agreement *at the posit*: `ln R_p` is **exp-sensitive to `α_s`**, so the running-consistent window `1/α_s ∈ [49, 52]` gives the band `[14π, 104π/7] ≈ [43.98, 46.67]` (`hierarchy_log_band`), measured 44.01 inside near the `14π` edge (the data implies `1/α_s ≈ 49.0`, so `b₀²=49` is the favoured end). Value-level ~3%; whole mass scale from the integer `7` ([`Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md`](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md)) |
| **Gravitational coupling** `α_G = G m_p²/ℏc` | 5.906 × 10⁻³⁹ (the "strength of gravity") | The *dimensionless* content of `G`: `α_G = (m_p/M_Planck)² = exp(−2 ln(M_Pl/m_p)) = exp(−28π)`, since the mass hierarchy is `ln(M_Pl/m_p)=14π` from the single substrate integer `b₀=7`. **Lean-verified** `substrate_gravitational_coupling` (`QLF_GravitationalCoupling.lean`) | **0.068% on the log** (`exp(−28π)=6.27×10⁻³⁹` vs 5.91×10⁻³⁹; 6.2% on the value — the `14π` exp-sensitivity). The *strength* of gravity from the integer `7`; absolute SI `G = α_G·ℏc/m_p²` then needs only `m_p`'s kg value (unit convention). The `η`/`4log2` entropy-normalization residual (`QLF_HolographicDensity`) is separate |

### Atomic, nuclear, and particle observables

| Observable | Value | QLF route | Precision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hydrogen spectrum `E_n = −Ry/n²` | NIST Lyman/Balmer | QLF Bohr from §§2-4; Dirac residual structurally decomposed in [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md) into three substrate origins (Cross_Frequency_Lorentz kinematic + Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics single-α² spin-orbit + Per_Qubit Compton zitterbewegung Darwin) | 0.053% Bohr → ~0.002–0.003% with Dirac + reduced-mass (n=1: 0.0002%) |
| **21cm hyperfine line** | 1420.4 MHz | `ΔE_HFS = (4/3) α⁴ g_p (m_e/m_p) m_e c²` from spatial-dynamics framing | 0.054% (1421 MHz pred) |
| **von Klitzing constant `R_K`** (quantum Hall) | 25812.807 Ω | `R_K = h/e² = Z₀/(2α)`; with substrate `α = 1/137`, `R_K = Z₀·137/2`. **Lean-verified** `von_klitzing_substrate` in `QLF_CondensedMatter.lean`; integer-QHE plateaus `R_xy = R_K/ν` | **0.026%** (25806 Ω pred; exactly the α error — the most precise resistance in metrology reading back the substrate α) |
| **Atomic-system masses** | Ps 1.022 MeV, Mu 106.17 MeV, H 938.78 MeV | Per-qubit Compton accounting `m c² = E_Planck / R` | Exact via depth ratios (§5.5) |
| **m_p/m_e** (Lenz factor) | 1836.118 | `|S_3| · π⁵ = 6π⁵` from 3-quark Bose permutation × 5-angle hidden-chirality integration. **Lean-verified** as `mass_ratio_QLF_eq` in `QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean` | **0.002%** vs PDG 1836.152 (zero free parameters) |
| **Lepton mass ratios** | m_p/m_e=1836.15, m_μ/m_e=206.77, m_τ/m_μ=16.82 | Depth ratios `m_X/m_Y = R_Y/R_X` | PDG-exact (§5.5) |
| **Spin-independence of the Coulomb interaction** | exact — the direct term carries no spin dependence; the singlet–triplet splitting is entirely exchange | **Derived from the alphabet, not computed.** `twistCharge` vanishes on all six spatial twists, so charge is a function of the gauge counts alone (`chiralCharge_determined_by_gauge`) and two modes differing only in spatial content — any spin, any harmonic — carry **exactly zero** charge difference (`no_charge_between_spatial_modes`). Charge lives on the gauge axis; spin and energy live on the spatial axes. Independently, the coherent cross term between distinct full-cycle harmonics or opposite spin channels is exactly zero (`channelKernel_diagonal`, from `harmonics_orthogonal` + `spin_projectors_orthogonal`). **Lean-verified**, zero axioms, [`QLF_ElectronClosure`](lean/QLF_ElectronClosure.lean); [`Electron.md`](Electron.md) §1c | **exact, structural** — QED agrees; QLF obtains it from the alphabet rather than from a matrix element. **Not claimed:** that the shared gauge deficit vanishes — that residue is the ordinary charge, and unequal-energy electrons still scatter (`joint_closure_allows_unequal_components`) |
| **Charge neutrality of closed systems** | exact | **`zfa_closure_is_neutral`** — a ZFA-closed history has `chiralCharge = 0`, because charge *is* the unmatched gauge count (`chiralCharge_eq_gauge_counts`). Charge conservation and integer quantization follow from the count, not from a field. **Lean-verified**, zero axioms | **exact, structural** — reproduces conservation + quantization; the electron's `+1` is precisely the part of it that has not closed |
| **Three fermion generations** | exactly 3 | Generation count = spatial-axis count `substrate_spatial_dimension = 3` — the same `3` as Koide's `N=3` phases, colour `SU(3)`, and α's `N=9=3²`. **Lean-verified** as `num_generations_eq_three` / `three_axis_signature` in `QLF_Generations.lean`; the 3 generations realized as Koide's three 120° phases | structural — reduces "why 3 generations" to "why 3 spatial dimensions," **derived** as the minimal graph-rendering dimension ([SpaceTime.md](SpaceTime.md) §3a) |
| **Weinberg angle `sin²θ_W`** (unification scale) | 3/8 (SU(5) GUT value) | Spatial fraction of the 8-twist alphabet `3/8` = the Georgi–Glashow GUT normalization — third constant from the 6+2 split (with α's `3²`, `Ω_Λ`'s `2/8`). **Lean-verified** `sin2_weinberg_substrate_eq` / `electroweak_substrate_signature` in `QLF_WeinbergAngle.lean` | structural at unification; the **RG-running structure is now anchored** (β-triple + running direction below), but the measured `0.231` at `M_Z` needs the absolute GUT scale (the open EW anchor `v`, #121) — [`Weak_Force.md`](Weak_Force.md) §2, §6 |
| **SM one-loop β-coefficients** | `(b₁,b₂,b₃) = (41/10, −19/6, −7)` | The full triple from QLF substrate counts (colours = axes, 3 generations, the 15 hypercharges `Y=Q−T₃`, one Higgs doublet) + the universal one-loop weights `11/3, 2/3, 1/3` and GUT `3/5` — extending the QCD `b₀=7`. **Lean-verified** `sm_beta_triple` in `QLF_ElectroweakBeta.lean` | exact SM values (group-theory + derived counts); the `sin²θ_W 3/8→0.231` value + `M_GUT` need the absolute scale (structural formula `couplings_meet_at`, slope `b₁−b₂=109/15`, in `QLF_GUTScale.lean`) |
| **QED running coefficient** `dα⁻¹/d ln Q² = −(1/3π)Σ Nᶜ Q_f²` | `2/(3π)` per fermion; `Σ Nᶜ Q_f² = 8` | The one-loop coefficient `2/(3π)` from the two-vertex split census (`∑ k(n−k)=C(n+1,3)`, the `3`; the `→1/6` Feynman-integral limit **proven**) × the Wallis `π`; the running *function* = the census octave count; the charge weighting **`Σ Nᶜ Q_f² = 8 = 2³`** (leptonic 3 + hadronic 5) from QLF's SM content. **Lean-verified** `qedVacPolCoeff_eq`, `octave_tower_recovers_qed_log`, `totalChargeCensus_eq_eight` (`QLF_VacuumPolarization`/`…Tower`/`QLF_ChargeCensus`) | structure value-free (Step-0, #117); matches QED's coefficient + the SM `R`-ratio charge sum `8`. The absolute `α(M_Z)` value needs the mass-spectrum thresholds (= the scale `v`) + non-perturbative `Δα_had` (open in the SM itself) |
| **Gauge anomaly cancellation** | all five vanish per generation | Matter neutrality `Σ Q = 0` and the gravitational/`[U(1)]³`/`[SU(2)]²U(1)`/`[SU(3)]²U(1)`/`[SU(3)]³` anomalies **all cancel** on the SU(5) `5̄⊕10=15` content — gauge consistency as ZFA ledger-closure. **Lean-verified** `generation_anomaly_free` / `gen_electric_neutral` (`QLF_AnomalyCancellation`/`QLF_ChargeBalance`) | exact (the SM's consistency miracle, from QLF-derived charges); a *derivation* of anomaly-freedom, not an imposed constraint |
| **Koide relation `Q = 2/3`** → **m_τ** | Q = 0.666661 (PDG); m_τ = 1776.86 MeV | `Q = 2/3` follows by construction from `N=3 ∧ A²=2` (three 120° phases); given m_e, m_μ it predicts m_τ. **Lean-verified** `koide_two_thirds` / `koide_three_phase` in `QLF_Koide.lean` | **0.006%** on m_τ (zero free parameters) |
| **Charged-pion / electron ratio** | m_π±/m_e = 273.13 (PDG) | `m_π±/m_e = |S₂|/α = 2/α = 274` (two quarks × exposed chirality). **Lean-verified** `pion_electron_ratio_eq` in `QLF_PionMassRatio.lean` | **0.3%** (the `1/α` exposed-vs-hidden mechanism is the open piece) |
| **Electron anomalous moment `a_e`** | a_e = 1.15965 × 10⁻³ (CODATA) | Schwinger `a_e = α/(2π)` from half-spin Pauli-return × loop phase `1/2π`; **zero empirical input** (a_e is dimensionless — neither h nor m_e enters). **Lean-verified** `a_e_QLF_eq_schwinger` in `QLF_GMinusTwo.lean` | **0.18%** (the substrate-α 0.026% gap propagated) |
| **Primordial helium fraction `Y_p`** | 0.247 (observed) | Every surviving neutron → deepest light closure ⁴He, so `Y_p = 2r/(1+r)`; freeze-out `r = n/p = 1/7` ⟹ `Y_p = 1/4`. **Lean-verified** `helium_fraction_one_seventh` in `QLF_Nucleosynthesis.lean` | ~1% (`r` itself needs `G_F`, open) |
| **Nuclear magic numbers** | 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126 | Dimensional growth (d=2,3,4 → 2,8,20) + vacuum-as-intruder + ℓ=3 threshold | All seven exact, end-to-end (§7.1) |
| **Stern-Gerlach separation** | ~22 mm at 100 T/m / 10 cm | Spatial-dynamics gradient on like-spin atoms | matches standard SG (§6 magnetism) |
| **Heavier-atom depth panel** | ¹H–²³⁸U, R ∝ 1/A baseline | Per-qubit Compton + vacuum-resonance peaks (⁴He, ¹⁶O, ⁴⁰Ca, ⁵⁶Fe, ⁹⁰Zr, ¹⁴⁰Ce, ²⁰⁸Pb) | structurally consistent (§5.6) |
| **⁵⁶Fe BE/A peak** | Cosmological terminator of stellar nucleosynthesis | Deepest stable vacuum-resonance peak below gauge-fold transition | Identified (§5.6) |
| **Pair-production threshold** | `E_γ = 2 m_e c² = 1.022 MeV` | Bit-to-qubit conversion at gauge-fold-creation event | Matches Bethe-Heitler (§6.5) |
| **Delayed-choice eraser** | No signal-marginal interference | Joint-ZFA framing — no signalling-class result | Consistent with 40+ years of data (§10) |

### Structural frameworks unified under QLF

| Framework | QLF reading | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| **Maxwell's equations** | Twist-imbalance + Gauss duality `divB + charge = 0` | §4, `∇·B=0` Lean-verified |
| **Lorentz boost** | Change-of-basis on Markov-blanket internal ZFA event rates; γ = cosh(rapidity) | Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md, §4.5 |
| **Constancy of c** | ρ-cancellation `(ρ·L_Planck)/(ρ·τ_Planck) = L_Planck/τ_Planck` at every Markov-blanket depth | Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md §5.3, Lean-anchored |
| **Information-energy equivalence** | `ℏω = 1 bit at frequency ω` | §6.4, recovers Margolus-Levitin + Landauer |
| **Half-spin closure** | Pauli closure = SU(2)-scalar-return face; count balance = Hermitian-pair multiset face | HALF-SPIN-ZFA-EMBEDDING.md §3a, Lean-verified across three layers |
| **Vacuum-alignment principle** | ZFA = alignment condition, MRE = quantum, active inference = dynamics | §6.6 TOE-completing layer, Lean-anchored per-event + N-event + RhoProcess |
| **Magnetism** | Spatial dynamics from spin-spin interactions: like-spin exclusion expansion + opposite-spin singlet contraction + B-field as directional gradient | Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md |
| **Hyperfine α⁴ form** | Two pairwise spin-orbit couplings (each α²) combining to α⁴ in joint spin-spin coupling | §6 magnetism, demonstrated to 0.054% |
| **Adjoint involution H ↔ H†** | Operator-side counterpart of Riemann ξ critical-line `s ↔ 1−s`; runtime `/conj` slash command in QuantumOS | ReverseMathematics.md §4.9 |
| **Hadronic depth** | geometric cosmic depth `n ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰` (primordial-blanket `v(R_H) ≈ R_H/l_P`) gives cosmic age (13.8 Gyr) and size (~10²⁶ m). The **age is a count of Planck ticks** `t₀ = n · τ_Planck`: `ℏ` fixes the tick `τ_Planck = √(ℏG/c⁵)`, the substrate fixes the count `n` — so the age is *derived, not empirical* (`H_0`/the overall scale = the single residual calibration ≡ deriving `n`). The proton cube `(m_Planck/m_p)³ ≈ 2.2×10⁵⁷` reproduces `n` only to ~3–4 orders (large-number coincidence, not precise) | HadronicDepth.md §2.1, AgeOfUniverse.md §4.1, UniversalRelativity.md §5 |
| **Electricity / Ohm's law** | Resistance = ZFA closure latency `R ∝ 1/W_ZFA`; superconductivity = quiet (gauge-only) frequency; von Klitzing `R_K = h/e² = Z₀/2α` with α substrate-derived; Joule heat = Landauer per closure | Electricity.md, demo `electricity_demo.py` (6/6 checks) |
| **Einstein field equations** | The field equations as the substrate's **equation of state** (Jacobson): `δQ = T δS` on every local horizon fixes `8πG = 2π/η`, `η = 1/4G`; integration constant `Λ = Ω_Λ = log 2`. Both inputs (area law + Unruh `T`) are substrate results | `QLF_EinsteinEquations.lean` (`einstein_coupling_from_thermodynamics`), [`Einstein_Equations.md`](Einstein_Equations.md); the full dynamical Einstein-tensor derivation is the named-open boundary; tensor composition and its quotient return are derived separately (`QLF_TensorFromClosure`, `QLF_TensorConservativeReturn`) |
| **Horizon temperatures (Unruh / Hawking / de Sitter)** | All three are the Unruh master `T = ℏa/(2πck_B)` at the right acceleration (the loop-phase `2π`); Hawking `ℏc³/(8πGMk_B)`, de Sitter `ℏH₀/(2πk_B)` | `QLF_HorizonTemperature.lean` (`hawking_is_unruh`, `desitter_is_unruh`) — algebraic unification |
| **Einstein equations & Kitada local time** | Jacobson's *local* Rindler horizon **is** the Markov-blanket / Kitada local clock; the equation of state holds at each local clock and `Λ = log 2` is the local-clock tick | [`Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md`](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.2, `QLF_LocalClock.lean` (`local_clock_tick_is_log_two`) |
| **Nuclear fusion & the weak force** | Two *identical* proton blankets are Pauli-insulated, so the pp-chain's first join needs a weak β⁺ step (the proton/neutron "sex"); **muon-catalyzed fusion = legitimate cold fusion**, reproduced in agreement with the Standard Model — catalysis touches the rate, never the β⁺ necessity | `QLF_Fusion.lean` (`pp_join_requires_distinguishability`), `QLF_MuonCatalysis.lean`, [`Fusion.md`](Fusion.md) |
| **Yang–Mills mass gap** | Vacuum = identity closure; lightest non-vacuum gauge closure carries one `log 2` quantum ⟹ positive gap `gaugeMassGap = log 2` | `QLF_MassGap.lean` (`mass_gap_quantum_pos`); continuum existence the named boundary axiom |
| **Millennium program (all six Clay problems)** | Each reduced to a constructive RCA₀ core + one named boundary axiom marking the continuum/choice crossing where ZFC is *itself* proven to fail (the continuum = math's UV catastrophe) | `QLF_Riemann`, `QLF_MassGap`, `QLF_BSD`, `QLF_Hodge`, `QLF_PvsNP`, `QLF_NavierStokes`; [`Millennium.md`](Millennium.md), [`Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md`](Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md) |
| **Ubiquitous scaling laws** (π · Kolmogorov −5/3 · 1/f pink noise · Zipf's law) | The closure census is a closed random walk (`C(2n,n)`); each of these four continuum universals is *one reading* of that single discrete object — computed exactly (no Monte-Carlo). Zipf is discrete-native (no clean continuum form) | §6.7; `QLF_CensusBrownian`, `QLF_PhysicalPi`, `QLF_Kolmogorov`; [`Turbulence.md`](Turbulence.md), [`brownian_closures.py`](brownian_closures.py) |
| **Neutrino oscillation** (Super-K / SNO / KamLAND — measured) | Oscillation is a norm-preserving precession of the Majorana three-axis closure: flavor conversion **conserves neutrino number** (`flavor_precession_conserves_number`), two-flavor probabilities are unitary + bounded (rooted in PMNS `cos²θ+sin²θ=1`), and are driven by the fold-depth splitting `Δm²=1/R_i²−1/R_j²` — nonzero oscillation ⟹ non-degenerate depths ⟹ nonzero Majorana masses. Structure Lean-verified; the *angles* + absolute `Δm²` open (Yukawa sector) | `QLF_NeutrinoOscillation`, `QLF_PMNS`; [`Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md`](Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md) §3 |
| **The hierarchy problem — absent by construction** | Mass is a *finite* gauge-fold depth, not a fundamental continuum scalar; the Planck floor caps it (`hierarchy_mass_bounded_by_floor`, `m=1/R≤1/R_min`) so there is no `Λ_UV→∞`, no `∝Λ_UV²` quadratic sensitivity, no fine-tuned cancellation. The Higgs is the radial mode of the *collective* fold-depth ledger (§2a); Zipf/`1/f` is the scale-free signature of the self-organized tangle. The LHC naturalness nulls (§9a) are the experimental face | `QLF_HiggsTurbulence`, `QLF_PlanckScale`; [`Higgs.md`](Higgs.md) §5b, §9a |

| **Degree of unsaturation** | The textbook `DoU = (2C+2+N−H−X)/2` **is the cycle rank** `b₁ = E−V+1 = Σ(vᵢ−2)/2 + 1` of the molecular graph, so each element's coefficient is `(valence−2)/2` — and **oxygen's is zero**, which is why it is absent from the formula (a cancellation, not a convention). Hence a ring and a double bond are **one** phenomenon, an independent closure, and *saturated* means **zero** closures. And since a balanced reaction pins `V` and `E`, leaving only the molecule count free in `b₁ = E − V + k`, **a reaction's change in closure count is its change in molecule count** — organic chemistry's addition / elimination / substitution taxonomy is that single number (verified over a table of named reactions, the peptide bond among them, in the closure-neutral class). Checks against published values: the alkane isomer series (OEIS A000602) reproduced **exactly through C₁₄** from *max degree 4 as the only rule applied*; the merged closure class gives C₄H₈ → 5, C₅H₁₀ → 10, C₆H₁₂ → 25, each the textbook constitutional-isomer total | `QLF_Unsaturation.lean` (`dou_chno`, `divalent_neutral`, `saturated_iff_alkane`); [`Chemistry.md`](Chemistry.md) §10, [`hydrocarbon_census.py`](hydrocarbon_census.py) (8 invariants, in CI) |
| **Protein folding** | A conformation **is** a twist history (the six signed axis steps *are* the six spatial twists), and a **contact is a ZFA closure**: segment plus contact edge has zero net displacement, hence count-balanced, hence Pauli-closed by the keystone — both conjuncts, the second free. The lattice-protein **parity rule** (contacts only at odd sequence separation) follows from count balance rather than being a lattice artefact, and the contact energy is the substrate's own `log 2` rather than a fitted `ε`. Checks: self-avoiding-walk counts reproduce OEIS A001411/A001412; loop-closure multiplicity falls `0.122 → 0.013` from span 3 to 9 (a single-loop count); the 4×4 designability census reproduces Li–Helling–Tang–Wingreen (69 structures, designability 21–521, 21.8% of sequences folding). **Proven no-go:** the mirror is a closure-preserving bijection, so counting cannot select a handedness — homochirality is upstream. **And a withdrawn bridge, recorded here because this table is the ledger:** the derived `Σ log ℓ` was regressed against the folding rates of 26 two-state proteins and **failed** (`|r| = 0.21` against `0.91` for plain relative contact order, §5e) — the fold census does not predict rates, and `closedLoop_append` does not license multiplicities factorizing over contacts | `QLF_Folding.lean` (`contact_is_closure`, `contact_separation_odd`, `map_mirror_bijective`); [`Protein_Folding.md`](Protein_Folding.md), [`protein_census.py`](protein_census.py) (10 invariants, in CI) |

### Lean-verified theorems (more than a hundred active modules, zero `sorry`)

- `no_magnetic_monopoles` — ∇·B = 0 from ZFA closure (ZFAEventDynamics.lean)
- `spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric` — spectral gap = 0 ↔ ZFA symmetry (QLF_Spectral.lean)
- `find_stable_states_length_even` — stable states at depth 2n = C(2n,n) (QLF_Riemann.lean)
- `bra_ket_always_balanced` — every constructed bra-ket is count-balanced (BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)
- **`count_balanced_pauli_closed`** — count balance ⟹ Pauli closure for ALL twist histories, general (QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean); supported by `axisMatrix_mul`, `nf_decomp`, `axisProd_eq_I_of_countBalanced`, with `pauli_closed_of_admissible_zfa`/`hermitian_pair_is_pauli_scalar`/`concat_pairs_is_pauli_scalar` as the earlier concatenation cases (QLF_Pauli.lean, QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean)
- `zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy` — per-event ΔF = −log 2 saturation (QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)
- `vacuum_alignment_selects_zfa`, `global_alignment_selects_zfa`, `rho_process_alignment_saturates` — three-layer vacuum-alignment principle (QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean, QLF_RhoProcessBridge.lean)
- `substrate_light_speed_from_cosmic_ratio`, `local_light_speed_invariant` — `c = L_Planck/τ_Planck` substrate identity (QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean)
- **`alpha_QLF_eq` — α = 1/137 from substrate combinatorics, zero free parameters (QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean)**; with `alpha_QLF_2d_counterfactual`, `alpha_QLF_4d_counterfactual`, `only_3d_substrate_gives_137` ties α to the empirical 3-dimensionality of space
- **`QLF_AlphaRigidity` — the α⁻¹ = 137 cross-sector overdetermination joint, zero axioms**: `alpha_unique` (`128 + d² = 137 ⟺ d = 3`), `rival_excluded` (no rendering dimension but `d=3` reaches 137 — the no-slack lemma), `inverseAlpha_three_prime`/`_elementary` (the elementarity sector agrees; `prime_below_15_only_three` + `inverseAlpha_fifteen_prime` fence it at "agrees, not selects"), `alpha_counts_dimension` (`α⁻¹ − 128 = d²`). `d` substrate-derived, so this is overdetermination (three independent sectors meeting) not a fit
- **`mass_ratio_QLF_eq` — m_p/m_e = 6π⁵ from substrate (QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean)**, the Lenz coincidence as structural prediction; `|S_3| = 6` × `π⁵` from 3-quark Bose permutation × 5-angle hidden-chirality integration; counterfactual theorems `mass_ratio_2_quark_eq`, `mass_ratio_4_angle_eq`, `mass_ratio_6_angle_eq` show 2-quark/4-angle/6-angle alternatives all miss PDG by 67-214%; 0.002% match to PDG `m_p/m_e = 1836.152`
- **`total_angular_DOF_eq_five` — 5-angle count structurally decomposed (QLF_BorromeanAngles.lean)**: `5 = 3 + 2` where `3` is the standard 3-body Jacobi internal DOF (`9 − 3 − 3 = 3`, rigorous) and `2` is the chirality-mixing per gauge-fold (Pauli scalar 2-axis structure); bridge theorem `matches_lenz_hidden_chirality_angles` ties this to `QLF_LenzMassRatio.hidden_chirality_angles`; counterfactual theorems show 2-quark → 2 DOF and 4-quark → 8 DOF, only 3-quark gives 5
- **`gamma_QLF_structural` — γ = 0.5772156649 via harmonic-excess identity (QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean)**: `harmonic`, `harmonic_excess`, and `gamma_QLF` Lean-anchored; small-N theorems (`harmonic_one`, `harmonic_excess_one`); 0.017% numerical match via `constants_mapper.emerge_gamma()`; convergence proof deferred (research-grade)
- **`qlf_zeta_substrate_bridge` — γ_QLF IS ζ's Laurent constant at s = 1 (QLF_RiemannZeta.lean)**: bridges QLF's substrate-derived γ to the global Riemann zeta function via the Laurent expansion `ζ(s) = 1/(s−1) + γ + O(s−1)`; `critical_line_real_part = 1/2` Lean-anchored as the balance ratio matched to the functional-equation fixed locus. The substrate bridges are proven; RH itself is reduced to the spectral boundary in `QLF_Riemann.lean` (`rh_proof_in_progress : True`) — the analytic sector QLF's thesis flags as ZFC-pathological, stated as the honest open bridge (RH is not a known independence result); consolidates substrate γ work with the existing QLF Riemann program
- **`hydrogen_spectrum_from_h_and_m_e` — Dirac correction Lean-anchored (QLF_DiracCorrection.lean)**: three mechanism factors (kinematic α²/2, spin-orbit α², Darwin α²) packaged with the Sommerfeld combined formula `dirac_correction_over_Ry`; ground-state special case `dirac_ground_state : ΔE/Ry = −α²/4`, substrate-α evaluation `dirac_ground_state_substrate : ΔE/Ry = −1/75076`, fine-structure splitting `fine_structure_n2_splitting`, reduced-mass factor `reduced_mass_factor_QLF = 6π⁵/(1+6π⁵)` from `QLF_LenzMassRatio`. Headline conjunction: α + m_p/m_e + reduced-mass all substrate-derived; only m_e enters as empirical input
- **`lamb_shift_substrate_summary` — Lamb shift Lean-anchored (QLF_LambShift.lean)**: substrate Bethe-log range `substrate_bethe_log_range n = log(2 n² / α²)` between electron Compton depth and bound-shell binding depth; α⁵ scaling `lamb_alpha_scaling_eq` from four-factor decomposition (Bohr α², emit vertex α, reabsorb vertex α, |ψ(0)|² density α); combined formula `lamb_shift_over_m_e_c2 n k_n_0 = (4/(3π n³)) × α⁵ × (2 log(1/α) − k(n,0))`. Demo: 2S₁/₂ Lamb shift matches NIST to 2.5% from h + m_e + standard QED Bethe constant; substrate derivation of k(n,0) Tier-3 open
- **`a_e_substrate_summary` — Schwinger anomaly Lean-anchored (QLF_GMinusTwo.lean)**: bare g = 2 from half-spin Pauli-scalar-return (`bare_g_factor`); Schwinger α/(2π) one-loop from substrate two-factor decomposition (`dressed_vertex_alpha = α`, `schwinger_loop_phase = 1/(2π)`); identity `a_e_QLF_eq_schwinger : a_e_QLF = α/(2π)`; substrate-α evaluation `a_e_QLF_substrate : a_e_QLF = 1/(274π)`; full g-factor `g_factor_QLF_eq : g = 2 + α/π`. **Zero empirical input** — a_e is dimensionless, neither h nor m_e enters; first QLF substrate prediction of a measurable observable with no observed-quantity input. Matches CODATA `a_e = 1.15965 × 10⁻³` to **0.18%** (substrate-α 0.026% gap propagated linearly)
- **`gravity_substrate_summary` — Newton's law from substrate Lean-anchored (QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean)**: holographic surface event count `holographic_event_count R = 4π R²` (3D substrate); per-event entropy `per_event_entropy = log 2`; total horizon entropy `holographic_entropy_eq : S(R) = 4π R² log 2`; Newton form exponent `newton_exponent 3 = 2` (3D-substrate signature, with counterfactuals `newton_exponent 2 = 1` and `newton_exponent 4 = 3`); structural form `G = L_Planck² c³ / ℏ` packaged as `GravitationalConstant.G_value_eq`. Verlinde-style derivation: F = T(holographic equipartition) × dS/dx(Bekenstein) = GMm/r² falls out structurally. G in SI is unit-conversion bookkeeping
- **`mercury_perihelion_substrate_summary` — Mercury perihelion 43"/century Lean-anchored (QLF_MercuryPerihelion.lean)**: Schwarzschild radius `schwarzschild_radius G M c = 2GM/c²`; per-orbit perihelion advance `perihelion_advance_per_orbit R_s a e = 3π R_s/(a(1-e²))`; equivalent form `perihelion_advance_from_GMc G M c a e = 6πGM/(c²a(1-e²))`; form-equivalence theorem `perihelion_advance_form_equivalence`; extraction identity `perihelion_advance_extracts_R_s` (Δφ × a × (1-e²) / 3π = R_s); per-century scaling `perihelion_advance_per_century_eq`. Mercury demo: 42.99"/century vs Park et al. 2017 measured 42.98"/century → **0.03% match** with G + c substrate-derived, only M_Sun, a_Mercury, e_Mercury, T_Mercury as astronomical inputs
- **`cosmological_constant_substrate_summary` — Cosmological constant Λ + Ω_Λ Lean-anchored (QLF_CosmologicalConstant.lean)**: gauge-axis fraction `gauge_axis_fraction_eq : f_gauge = 2/8 = 1/4` from the 6+2 alphabet split (same split that gives α via N=9=3²); substrate-derived dark-energy fraction `Omega_Lambda_QLF = log 2`; Friedmann prefactor `vacuum_energy_prefactor = 3 log 2 / (8π)`; decomposition theorem `vacuum_energy_prefactor_decomposition` (= f_gauge × 3 log 2 / 2π); counterfactual `only_2_gauge_matches_observed_Omega_Lambda` (4-gauge gives 2 log 2, 0-gauge gives 0). **Vacuum catastrophe of 10¹²² closed structurally** via `(R_H/L_P)²` surface-vs-volume × T_dS-vs-T_Planck. Demo: ρ_Λ_QLF = 5.32×10⁻¹⁰ vs measured 5.83×10⁻¹⁰ J/m³ (8.8%), Ω_Λ_QLF = log 2 = 0.693 vs measured 0.685 (**1.2% match — substrate predicts the dark-energy fraction**)
- **`mond_acceleration_horizon_form` — dark-matter / MOND acceleration scale Lean-anchored (QLF_DarkMatter.lean)**: the crossover acceleration `a₀ = cH₀/(2π) = c²/(2π R_H)` sits on the **same Hubble radius `R_H = c/H₀`** that fixes `Ω_Λ = log 2` (so dark matter and dark energy close on one horizon). Transition radius `mond_radius_accel : GM/σ² = a₀` with `σ = √(GM/a₀)`; dense/sparse crossover `newtonian_dominates_iff : a₀ < GM/r² ⟺ r² < GM/a₀` (dense interior = Newton/GR — Mercury, hadron quantum black holes; sparse exterior = apparent dark matter); baryonic Tully–Fisher `tully_fisher_flat : v⁴ = GMa₀`; Gaussian MRE congestion bump `gaussian_denser_near_center`. **The rotation-curve law is derived** — the closure-balance RAR `radialAccel_self_consistent` (both limits exact) — and the **blind SPARC benchmark** (147 galaxies, baryonic-only, sealed, parameter-free) hits the observational floor `0.133 dex` (= best-fit MOND, vs Newton ×2.7, NFW 294 params; [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md)). Fit in QLF's own form the data prefers `a₀=cH₀/2π` at **H₀=72.9** (local) → `1/2π` confirmed to **<1%**; residual = the Hubble tension. Open: a first-principles `2π` + the form as the *unique* ν (`dark_matter_acceleration_scale_in_progress`)
- **`primordial_markov_blanket_substrate_summary` — Primordial Markov blanket as Fuller geodesic sphere Lean-anchored (QLF_PrimordialMarkovBlanket.lean)**: Fuller subdivision formulas `V_v = 10v² + 2`, `E_v = 30v²`, `F_v = 20v²`; Euler invariant `primordial_blanket_euler : V - E + F = 2` at every frequency; 12 pentamons invariant (`pentamons_invariant`); holographic event count `holographic_event_count_blanket_eq : N_events = F_v = 20v²` — substrate-identifies the `4π R²/L_Planck²` count used in v1.3.0 Newton's law / v1.4.0 Mercury / v1.5.0 Λ; **McKay correspondence anchor `mckay_2I_E8_anchor`**: binary icosahedral group `|2I| = 120` ↔ E_8 (`dim E_8 = 248`). Every Markov blanket in QLF is a primordial blanket at frequency `v(R) = √(π/5)·R/L_Planck`; cosmic Markov blanket has `v_cosmic ≈ 6.7×10⁶⁰`. **E_8 symmetry structurally encoded in the substrate via McKay**
- `decoherence_impossibility` — parallel composition stays ZFA-balanced
- `emergent_blanket_formation` — count balance under concatenation (QLF_QuCalc.lean)
- `8π = 4π · 2` — Einstein-equation geometric factor as solid-angle × Hermitian-pair (QLF_EinsteinGeometricFactor.lean)
- `R = local clock count` foundational identity (QLF_LocalClock.lean)

**Added since (the Standard Model, gravity-as-equation-of-state, and the Millennium program):**
- `koide_two_thirds` — Koide `Q = 2/3` ⟹ m_τ to 0.006% (QLF_Koide.lean); `pion_electron_ratio_eq` — `m_π±/m_e = 2/α` (QLF_PionMassRatio.lean)
- `num_generations_eq_three`, `sin2_weinberg_substrate_eq` — 3 generations / `sin²θ_W = 3/8` (QLF_Generations, QLF_WeinbergAngle); `beta_coefficient_eq_seven` — QCD `b₀ = 7` (QLF_BetaFunction.lean)
- `hierarchy_log_eq_fourteen_pi` — the Planck/proton hierarchy `= 14π` from the single integer 7 (QLF_AlphaS.lean), with `QLF_MassSpectrum`/`QLF_AlphaS` reducing the whole spectrum to one scale; the **bounds pass** `hierarchy_log_band` / `hierarchy_band_width` makes the `α_s` exp-sensitivity explicit (the `0.07%` is the agreement at the posit `α_s=1/b₀²`; the running-consistent `1/α_s∈[49,52]` gives the log-band `[14π, 104π/7]`, measured 44.01 inside near the `14π` edge)
- `theta_zero_on_closure` (strong-CP `θ̄=0` without an axion, QLF_StrongCP), Sakharov baryogenesis (QLF_Baryogenesis), `helium_fraction_one_seventh` (`Y_p=1/4`, QLF_Nucleosynthesis)
- `einstein_coupling_from_thermodynamics` — Einstein equations as equation of state `8πG = 2π/η` (QLF_EinsteinEquations.lean); `hawking_is_unruh`/`desitter_is_unruh` (QLF_HorizonTemperature.lean)
- `pp_join_requires_distinguishability` (fusion β⁺ keystone, QLF_Fusion) + `catalyzed_join_still_requires_beta` (muon-catalyzed cold fusion, QLF_MuonCatalysis)
- `disjunctive_closure` — information synthesis as OR-closure (QLF_InfoSynthesis.lean); `a_mu_leading_eq_a_e` (muon g−2 placed honestly, QLF_MuonG2)

## §1.2 The inventory database — counts and folds, accumulated and rechecked

The enumerations this document cites (the `count_balanced_pauli_closed` sweep, the closure-depth census,
the fold phases) are kept in [`data/census_inventory.json`](data/census_inventory.json), rebuilt and
**verified** by [`census_inventory.py`](census_inventory.py). It accumulates — each run keeps what is
already stored and computes only what is missing, so the record grows as compute allows — and it asserts
every proven invariant against freshly enumerated data, so a regression in `twist_core.py` surfaces at
once:

| Invariant | Lean anchor |
|---|---|
| count balance ⟹ Pauli closure | [`count_balanced_pauli_closed`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean) |
| count balance ⟹ the fold is `±I`, never `±iI` | [`balanced_phase_is_real`](lean/QLF_BalancedPhaseReal.lean) |
| unbalanced histories **do** reach `±iI` (the scope is sharp) | [`unbalanced_can_be_imaginary`](lean/QLF_BalancedPhaseReal.lean) |
| closure depth = maximum phase excursion | [`closedAtHorizon_iff_maxExcursion_le`](lean/QLF_ClosureDepthLaw.lean) |
| one-pass closures number `2ⁿ` | [`onePass_ways_iff`](lean/QLF_ClosureDepth.lean) |
| the deepest stratum holds exactly `2` | [`nested_closed_at_d`](lean/QLF_ClosureDepth.lean) |

### The schema

`data/census_inventory.json` is the canonical record; this section is its documentation. Two top-level
sections, `folds` and `depths`, both keyed by history length:

```
folds.by_length["8"]
  count                      total count-balanced twist histories of that length
  n_plus, n_minus            how many carry Pauli phase +1 / -1
  n_imaginary                how many carry +-i  (0 at every length — balanced_phase_is_real)
  signed_amplitude           n_plus - n_minus: the amplitude a census-spanning branch would carry
  weight_of_signed_amplitude its square — the Born weight of that branch, NOT the count
  histories_listed_in_full   true only to length 6; beyond that the lists below are 8 samples per phase
  histories_by_phase         the histories themselves, grouped by phase
folds.phase_rule             the rule, as a string (now proven: QLF_PhaseRule)
folds.phase_rule_violations  histories where the rule fails — MUST stay empty
folds.unbalanced_imaginary_* witnesses that unbalanced histories DO reach +-i (the scope is sharp)

depths["16"]
  total_ways                 balanced +/- histories of that length ( = central_binomial)
  strata                     {closure depth: how many ways close at exactly that depth}
  listening_by_capacity      {R: {ways_heard, fraction}} — the capacity-relative count, cumulative
  one_pass_ways              the depth-1 stratum ( = 2^n, onePass_ways_iff)
  deepest_stratum            the maximal-depth stratum ( = 2, nested_closed_at_d)
  modal_depth                the depth reached in the most ways — what happens most often (not first)
  depth_equals_max_excursion the depth law, checked ( = true, closedAtHorizon_iff_maxExcursion_le)
  strata_that_are_gaussian_norms  which stratum counts are sums of two squares (mostly not)
```

Counts are absolute; **listenings are capacity-relative**. `_invariants_asserted` lists what every run
re-checks, and a run that breaks one exits non-zero.

**It is enforced in CI.** [`.github/workflows/inventory-check.yml`](.github/workflows/inventory-check.yml)
runs `census_inventory.py --quick` on any change to `twist_core.py`, the builder, or the database:
the cheap lengths are re-enumerated from scratch and compared against what is stored (catching a
regression in the runtime), and every invariant is asserted over the whole stored file (catching a
corrupted or hand-edited database). Verified to fail as intended — an off-by-one in a stored count and a
broken `2ⁿ` invariant were both caught, exit code 1. The deep lengths are not re-enumerated on every
push; they are extended deliberately with `--twist-len` / `--phase-len` and committed.

### The data

**Fold census** — every count-balanced twist history, with the Pauli phase it carries:

| length | ways | phase `+1` | phase `−1` | phase `±i` | signed amplitude `Σζ` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 8 | 0 | 8 | **0** | `−8` |
| 4 | 168 | 144 | 24 | **0** | `+120` |
| 6 | 5,120 | 1,488 | 3,632 | **0** | `−2,144` |
| 8 | 190,120 | 116,008 | 74,112 | **0** | `+41,896` |
| 10 | 7,939,008 | 3,535,200 | 4,403,808 | **0** | `−868,608` |

The `±i` column is empty at every length — the content of
[`balanced_phase_is_real`](lean/QLF_BalancedPhaseReal.lean), here as an implementation check that
`twist_core.py` still matches the Lean model. The signed amplitude is what a *census-spanning* branch
would carry: sign `(−1)^{L/2}`, magnitudes `8, 120, 2144, 41896, 868608` — all divisible by 8, with
ratios `≈15, 17.9, 19.5, 20.7` rising and their increments falling. **Recorded, not explained** — the
closed form, if there is one, is unidentified, and four or five terms are not enough to guess from.

**Listening profile** — the *capacity-relative* count: what fraction of the census a horizon of capacity
`R` actually receives ([`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md) §3a rule 2; a **listening** is not a synonym for a
count):

| length | `R=1` | `R=2` | `R=3` | `R=4` | `R=5` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 0.229 | 0.771 | 0.971 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| 12 | 0.069 | 0.526 | 0.857 | 0.974 | 0.998 |
| 16 | 0.020 | 0.340 | 0.717 | 0.913 | 0.981 |
| 20 | 0.005 | 0.213 | 0.583 | 0.832 | 0.948 |

A shallow capacity hears only the shallow closures, each step up hears more
([`lines_mono`](lean/QLF_LineSpectra.lean)), and no finite capacity hears everything
([`law_of_exceptions`](lean/QLF_LawOfExceptions.lean)).

### One of them has since been proven

**The phase rule** `(−1)^{#neg twists} · sign(permutation sorting the axis word)` was this document's
flagship verified-not-proven finding — **0 violations** across all **8,134,416** balanced histories of
length ≤ 10, up from 5,296 at length ≤ 6, a **1,500× enlargement** that could have falsified it at any
point and did not, but proven only for the pair sector where the axis word is constant. It is now a
theorem for every balanced history at every length — **`phase_rule`**
([`QLF_PhaseRule`](lean/QLF_PhaseRule.lean)) — and in the stronger form
**`twist_fold_phase_normal_form`**, which drops the balance hypothesis and holds for *every* history,
returning the sorted product `σx^{#X}σy^{#Y}σz^{#Z}` where balance leaves the identity. The two factors
separate because signs pull out of a product regardless of order while distinct Pauli matrices
anticommute, so sorting the axis word costs exactly one `−1` per inversion.

So the enumeration above is now the finding's **discovery record and regression check**, not its
warrant — and the phase of any way is computable from the word alone, without multiplying a single
matrix.

### The findings that are verified but **not** proven

Kept separate so they cannot quietly harden into claims:

* **Which depth-stratum counts are Gaussian norms** — mostly they are *not* (`38, 14, 70, 422 …` are not
  sums of two squares), the concrete form of **counts are not weights**
  ([`born_generator_check.py`](born_generator_check.py)).

## §2 The Spectral Gap as Unifying Frame

The deepest single result behind everything that follows is the spectral-gap identity ([SpectralGap.md](SpectralGap.md)):

```
spectral_gap s = |count_pos s − count_neg s|
```

**Lean-verified**: `spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric` in [lean/QLF_Spectral.lean](lean/QLF_Spectral.lean):

```lean
theorem spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric (s : TopoString) :
    spectral_gap s = 0 ↔ is_symmetric s
```

The gap vanishes exactly when the string is ZFA-symmetric. Three further machine-verified theorems propagate this to every physical statement:

- `rho_process_always_zfa` ([RhoQuCalc.lean:382](lean/RhoQuCalc.lean)) — every constructible RhoProcess satisfies ZFA
- `bra_ket_always_balanced` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean:109](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)) — it is algebraically impossible to construct a ZFA-unbalanced RhoProcess
- `decoherence_impossibility` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)) — parallel composition stays ZFA-balanced

Together: the gap-zero subspace is algebraically closed and contains every physically constructible object. Everything that follows is a corollary or a numerical consequence of these facts.

### §2.1 ZFA = half-spin closure, with two algebraic faces

ZFA names a single structural principle — *the bra-ket of a half-spin spinor returns a scalar* — decomposed into two algebraic faces:

- **Pauli closure** (non-abelian / order-sensitive face): the ordered SU(2) product of twist Paulis lands in the scalar group `{+I, −I, +iI, −iI}`. This is the **SU(2)-scalar-return** reading of half-spin closure — the spinor returns to itself up to a global phase. The 8 twists are generators of the SU(2) algebra (the Σ₈ algebra of [Lagrangian_Formulation.md](Lagrangian_Formulation.md), with τᵢ = iσᵢ); SU(2) ≅ unit quaternions, and Hurwitz's theorem singles out H as the unique non-commutative associative composition real algebra (see [HALF-SPIN-ZFA-EMBEDDING.md §6](HALF-SPIN-ZFA-EMBEDDING.md)).
- **Count balance** (abelian / multiset face): `count_pos == count_neg`. The Hermitian-pair multiset count: each twist is paired with its Hermitian conjugate (bra-ket structure). Historically called the "bosonic" reading because it ignores order.

Pauli closure is not a "second condition" layered on top of count balance — it IS the SU(2)-scalar-return of the same half-spin closure that count balance reads as a Hermitian-pair multiset. Neither face implies the other in isolation: `σ_x σ_y σ_z = iI` is Pauli-closed but length-3, count-imbalanced; `^ < v -` is count-balanced but folds to σ_x. Both together are the unique characterisation of a closed half-spin process.

Twist → Pauli matrix mapping per the [Maxwell.md](Maxwell.md) axis assignments:

| Twist | Matrix | Axis |
|---|---|---|
| `^`, `v` | ±σ_y | Y |
| `>`, `<` | ±σ_x | X |
| `/`, `\` | ±σ_z | Z |
| `+`, `−` | ±I | gauge / U(1) phase |

Full ZFA is the conjunction:

```
achieves_zfa(h)  ≡  count_balanced(h)  ∧  pauli_closed(h)
```

This is enforced in every implementation of the kernel:

- **Python** (`twist_core.py`): `is_zfa` calls `is_pauli_closed` after the count check.
- **Rust** (`crates/zfa-core/src/history.rs` and `pauli.rs` in [quantum-os](https://github.com/rhovision-org/quantum-os)): `achieves_zfa` returns `is_count_balanced ∧ is_pauli_closed`; capability tokens use deterministic rejection sampling to guarantee closure.
- **TypeScript** (`packages/browser/src/zfa.ts`): mirrors the Rust check end-to-end, including the pure-TS Pauli matrix fold for the no-WASM fallback.

Empirically, **every count-balanced history is automatically Pauli-closed** in the QLF Python BFS ensemble at every length tested. This is **a Lean theorem** (`count_balanced_pauli_closed`, below): count balance alone implies Pauli closure, so the second conjunct of the runtime check is entailed by the first — the explicit enforcement formalizes an invariant that is provably present, not merely observed.

**Lean status (Pauli closure fully general).** The two algebraic kernels of the runtime `is_zfa = is_count_balanced ∧ is_pauli_closed` check are Lean-verified, and Pauli closure is proven for arbitrary histories (not just under concatenation):

- **Count balance**: `emergent_blanket_formation` in [`lean/QLF_QuCalc.lean`](lean/QLF_QuCalc.lean) §5 — any list of symmetric atoms concatenates into a symmetric collective. Pure RCA₀ induction.
- **Pauli closure**: `pauli_closed_of_admissible_zfa` in [`lean/QLF_Pauli.lean`](lean/QLF_Pauli.lean) — the four-element Pauli scalar group `{+I, -I, +iI, -iI}` is closed under multiplication, and `pauli_fold` is a multiplicative homomorphism. Captures the algebraic kernel of the runtime `is_pauli_closed` check.
- **Hardware-mapping bridge**: `hermitian_pair_is_pauli_scalar` in [`lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean) — every Hermitian-conjugate pair from the 8-twist alphabet folds, under its explicit σ-matrix mapping (`^v ↔ ±σ_y, <> ↔ ∓σ_x, /\ ↔ ±σ_z, +- ↔ ±I`), to the matrix `-I` (= image of `PauliScalar.negOne` under the canonical embedding). Bridges the abstract Pauli scalar group to the concrete matrix interpretation; closes the runtime-mapping caveat for Hermitian-pair atoms.
- **N-pair concatenation closure**: `concat_pairs_is_pauli_scalar` (and the parity-split corollaries `concat_pairs_even`, `concat_pairs_odd`) in [`lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean) — the matrix product of any concatenation of N Hermitian pairs from the 8-twist alphabet lands in the Pauli scalar group `{+I, -I}` (equals `+I` when N is even, `-I` when N is odd). The concatenation-only subset of the multi-pair bridge.
- **General Pauli closure (the keystone)**: `count_balanced_pauli_closed` in [`lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean`](lean/QLF_TwistAlphabet.lean) — **every count-balanced twist history** (`#^=#v ∧ #<=#> ∧ #/=#\ ∧ #+=#−`, i.e. `calculate_action = 0`) folds to a Pauli scalar `{+I, −I, +iI, −iI}`, for *all* histories, not only concatenations of adjacent Hermitian pairs. Proof: `nf_decomp` shows every fold equals `phase • axisMatrix(axisProd)` (via the 16-case `axisMatrix_mul`, built from the 9 σ-product identities `sigma_xy … sigma_xz`, plus the scalar-phase homomorphism `pauliScalarToMatrix_mul`); and the `(ZMod 2)²` axis-parity bridge `axisProd_eq_I_of_countBalanced` shows count balance yields the trivial axis (each Pauli axis occurs an even number of times). **So count balance alone implies Pauli closure** — the runtime `is_count_balanced ∧ is_pauli_closed` check is Lean-anchored end-to-end.

Cross-axis interleaving of partial pairs (e.g., `^<v>` mixing the y- and x-axes in one closure event) — previously the open piece — is covered by `count_balanced_pauli_closed`. The interleaved case `interleaved_xlvr_folds_to_negI` is the first instance, and the general theorem subsumes it. Empirically reconfirmed: **0 counterexamples across all 5,296 count-balanced histories of length ≤ 6**.

## §3 Spacetime Emergence

| Aspect | QLF result | Standard physics | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spatial basis | 6 of 8 twists generate 3D space (`^v<>/\`) | 3D space | By construction |
| Time | Constructed from the gauge pair `+`/`−` and directions beyond the local 3D perspective | 1D time | By construction |
| Speed of light c | Substrate event identity `c = L_Planck / τ_Planck` (one Planck length per Planck tick); equivalently, the cosmic-ratio identity `c = R_cosmic / T_cosmic = (n · L_Planck) / (n · τ_Planck)` with both `R_cosmic ≈ 8.8 × 10²⁶ m` and `T_cosmic ≈ 13.8 Gyr` QLF-derived from `n ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰` (Hadronic Depth, geometric primordial-blanket depth; `n` cancels in the ratio, so `c` is independent of its value) | 299 792 458 m/s | Derived from the substrate event quantum ([Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.3, [lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean](lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean)). L_Planck and τ_Planck are QLF substrate primitives; the SI numerical value reflects substrate-primitive-to-SI calibration. The cosmic-scale derivation independently agrees with observed cosmic age and size |
| Planck length l_P | ~1 spatial free action unit (in Planck units) | 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m | Order-of-magnitude identification |
| Planck time t_P | ~1 contribution from non-local directions (in Planck units) | 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ s | Order-of-magnitude identification |
| Photon | Pure spatial free action (zero gauge folds) → null interval, proper time τ = 0 | Null geodesic, τ = 0 | Matches: a process with zero gauge folds synthesizes zero ticks of local time |
| Massive particle | Finite gauge-fold rate → finite proper time | Timelike worldline, τ > 0 | Matches structurally |
| Lorentz boost | Change of basis on internal ZFA event rates of two Markov-blanket frames; γ = cosh(rapidity) with rapidity = log(internal-frequency ratio) | γ = 1/√(1−β²); time dilation; length contraction | Derived ([Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md)); recovers all three standard SR consequences from the per-blanket internal-clock structure |

Implementation: [SpaceTime.md](SpaceTime.md), `path_integral.py`. The substrate event identity `c = L_Planck / τ_Planck` (one Planck length per Planck tick) is QLF's foundational reading of the speed of light; L_Planck and τ_Planck are substrate primitives, not defined via `{ℏ, G, c}`. The cosmic-scale confirmation `c = R_cosmic / T_cosmic` is independent: `R_cosmic = n · L_Planck` and `T_cosmic = n · τ_Planck` with `n ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰` from Hadronic Depth (the geometric primordial-blanket depth) match observed cosmic size and age. The SI numerical value reflects substrate-primitive-to-SI calibration. Lean anchor in [`lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean`](lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean).

## §4 Maxwell's Equations from the 8-Twist Algebra

Maxwell's equations are not postulated. They emerge from the 8-twist ZFA algebra in the continuum limit. See [Maxwell.md](Maxwell.md) for the full mapping. Operational definitions:

```
B_x(h) = count(>) − count(<)
B_y(h) = count(^) − count(v)
B_z(h) = count(/) − count(\)
charge(h) = count(+) − count(−)
```

### §4.1 ∇·B = 0  —  No magnetic monopoles

**Lean-verified**: `no_magnetic_monopoles` in [lean/ZFAEventDynamics.lean](lean/ZFAEventDynamics.lean):

```lean
theorem no_magnetic_monopoles (e : ZFAEvent) : divB e.history = 0
```

ZFA closure requires every individual twist count to be zero. Therefore `B_x = B_y = B_z = 0` for any ZFA-closed event, and ∇·B vanishes identically. **Magnetic monopoles are algebraically impossible**, not merely unobserved.

**Numerically confirmed**: `maxwell_qlf.py` Report 1 — divB = 0 across 10 000 random ZFA-closed events.

### §4.2 ∇·E = ρ/ε₀  —  Gauss's law for electricity

The dual Gauss-electric identity, from [SpectralGap.md §3](SpectralGap.md):

```
divB(h) + charge(h) = 0   for any achieves_ZFA history h
```

The two Gauss laws are dual faces of a single gap identity. For charge-neutral events both vanish individually; for charge-imbalanced events the gauge imbalance acts as a source for the transverse polarity image. **Numerically confirmed**: `maxwell_qlf.py` Report 2.

### §4.3 Faraday and Ampère-Maxwell

The curl equations are now **machine-verified at the conservation level** on the time-indexed event sequence ([`QLF_MaxwellCurl.lean`](lean/QLF_MaxwellCurl.lean), issue #93), and confirmed numerically in `maxwell_qlf.py`:

- `maxwell_qlf.py` Report 3 confirms curl(E) ≈ −∂B/∂t in a 1D wave simulation.
- `maxwell_qlf.py` Report 4 confirms wave-propagation speed matches c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) to four significant figures.

**Lean status**: **Faraday and Ampère-Maxwell machine-verified (conservation form)**. The closure behind the Heaviside curl form is flux-conservation telescoping: Faraday's boundary EMF telescopes to minus the net magnetic-flux change (`faraday_integral`), so a closed magnetic cycle induces zero net EMF (`faraday_closed_cycle` — Faraday as a ZFA closure); Ampère-Maxwell is the dual with an enclosed source plus displacement current (`ampere_integral`). With `∇·B=0` (`no_magnetic_monopoles`) all four Maxwell equations are substrate-anchored at the conservation level; the full 3-D vector `∇×` (Stokes on the synthesized metric) is the continuum rendering.

### §4.4 Force law and energy accounting

For a monochromatic wave of wavelength λ, each thread exchanges momentum h/λ per cycle of duration λ/c. The thread-level force image is therefore

$$F = \frac{h/\lambda}{\lambda/c} = \frac{hc}{\lambda^2}$$

reproduced to machine precision in `magnetism.py`. Energy accumulates as `E = h × (logical bits traversed)`, recovering both `E = hν` and the classical Poynting integral.

### §4.5 Lorentz covariance — partially closed

The static-field decomposition above is established, and the **Lorentz boost between Markov-blanket frames** is derived in [Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md): γ = cosh(rapidity), with rapidity identified as the logarithm of the ratio of two frames' internal ZFA event rates. Recovers time dilation, length contraction, and interval invariance. The constancy of `c` is derived from the cosmic-ratio identity `c = R_cosmic / T_cosmic = L_Planck / τ_Planck` ([Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.3, [lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean](lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean)); the same ρ-cancellation gives `c_local = c_substrate` at any Markov-blanket depth.

The {E, B} mixing under boosts uses the Σ₈ generator algebra of [Lagrangian_Formulation.md](Lagrangian_Formulation.md):

$$\tau_i \tau_j = -\delta_{ij} I - \varepsilon_{ijk} \tau_k, \qquad \tau_i = i\sigma_i$$

(machine-verified `tau_xy_product`, `tau_yz_product`, `tau_zx_product` in [BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)). The τᵢ are the Pauli matrices times i; boosts act on them by the standard Lorentz-Pauli representation. Extending the discrete Maxwell formulas of §4.1–4.2 to time-indexed event sequences and showing the boost-mixing explicitly on EM fields (rather than on the kinematic boost itself) is the **remaining open piece**.

## §5 Hydrogen Spectrum — Quantitative Retrodiction

The single fully-worked QLF retrodiction of a precision-measured atomic observable. See [Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md) for the derivation chain and [hydrogen_qlf.py](hydrogen_qlf.py) for the reproducing script.

### §5.1 Bohr derivation in ZFA language

Hydrogen is a ZFA handshake: proton (persistent gauge `+` imbalance) ↔ electron (single gauge `−` fold). The integer n counts complete twist-pair closures per orbit. Stability is `spectral_gap = 0`, machine-verified. Stable states at depth 2n number exactly C(2n, n) (`find_stable_states_length_even`, [QLF_Riemann.lean:293](lean/QLF_Riemann.lean)).

α follows from the ionization energy of hydrogen and the electron rest energy via the QLF Bohr structural identity (see [Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md) §2/§4 and [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py)):

$$\alpha \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{2\, \mathrm{Ry}}{m_e c^2}} \;=\; 0.0072973526 \;=\; 1/137.036$$

to CODATA precision (10⁻¹⁰ relative error). Three tiers:
- **Tier 1 (structural):** the identity `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` is derived in [Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md) §§2-4 from Coulomb-via-gauge-twist-exchange + ZFA-depth quantization — *the form* of the relationship is QLF first-principles content.
- **Tier 2 (numerical, h + m_e only):** with substrate α from `QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean` (1/137.000), the Tier-1 identity gives **Ry from m_e alone** to 0.05% vs CODATA Ry (inheriting the 0.026% α residual squared). Combined with substrate `m_p/m_e = 6π⁵` (`QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean`) for the reduced-mass correction and the Dirac decomposition from [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md), the full hydrogen spectrum matches NIST to ~0.05% across `n = 1..6`. *No measured α, no measured m_p, no measured Ry are used.* The structural prediction holds empirically from h + m_e alone.
- **Tier 3 (candidate close, substrate-only, Lean-anchored):** the substrate combinatorial route in [`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §6.1 gives `α_QLF = (1/16) × (1/4) × (1/2) × 1 / (1 + 9 α) = 1/128 × 128/137 = 1/137.000`, matching CODATA at 0.026% with no observable input. The chain: naive closure rate (1/16, 8-twist alphabet) × gauge selectivity (1/4, '+-' is 1 of 4 base atoms) × phase coherence (1/2, binary in/out) × spatial co-location (1, λ_binding/2 >> a₀), corrected by emergent energy conservation (1+9α)⁻¹ with N=9 from the 3² spatial directional-coupling tensor. **Lean-verified** in [`lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean): `alpha_QLF_eq : alpha_QLF = 1/137`. Parallel pathway: [`Proton_Resonance_R_e.md`](Proton_Resonance_R_e.md) via R_e = R_p · 6π⁵.

The runnable demo also prints two equivalent re-expressions: per-qubit `α = sqrt(2 Ry R_e / E_Planck)` and depth-ratio `α² = 2 R_e / R_1`. Both involve `E_Planck` only as unit-conversion bookkeeping — `E_Planck` cancels algebraically, leaving the same observable ratio `Ry/(m_e c²)`. Forms 2 and 3 are not additional empirical claims. Combining the identity with the virial theorem for Coulomb attraction recovers the Bohr spectrum:

$$E_n = -\tfrac{1}{2}\,\alpha^2\, m_e c^2 / n^2$$

### §5.2 Comparison with NIST (`hydrogen_qlf.py` actual output)

```
α_QLF  = 0.0072973525643   (QLF value; cf. §6 for the derivation program)
α_NIST = 0.0072973525693   (CODATA 2018)
α relative error = 7 × 10⁻¹⁰   (effectively 0%)
```

Wiring α end-to-end from the twist algebra through to the hydrogen derivation is high-priority open work — see §6.

| n | E_n (QLF) | E_n (NIST) | Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | −13.605693 eV | −13.598434 eV | **−0.0534%** |
| 2 | −3.401423 | −3.399609 | −0.0534% |
| 3 | −1.511744 | −1.510937 | −0.0534% |
| 4 | −0.850356 | −0.849902 | −0.0534% |
| 5 | −0.544228 | −0.543937 | −0.0534% |
| 6 | −0.377936 | −0.377734 | −0.0534% |

**Bohr radius**: `a₀ (QLF) = 52.9177 pm`, matching CODATA to within the α precision.

**Lyman series** (n → 1), QLF vs NIST: λ matches to 0.053% per line.
**Balmer series** (n → 2), QLF vs NIST: λ matches to 0.025% per line.

### §5.3 The 0.053% residual is the Dirac correction — structurally decomposed

The Bohr model itself differs from NIST by 0.053%. The Dirac equation closes this gap; QLF decomposes the closure into three substrate origins in [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md):

- **Relativistic kinematic** — small-rapidity expansion `γ − 1 ≈ φ²/2` of [`Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md`](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md)'s `γ = cosh φ`, with bound-electron rapidity `φ ≈ α` (orbital velocity `v_1 = αc`).
- **Single-electron spin-orbit** — one-pair extraction from the hyperfine α⁴ chain in [`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §5, using the same `N = 9` directional-coupling tensor (§6.1.3) that produces substrate α.
- **Darwin contact term** — per-Compton-cycle zitterbewegung from [`Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md`](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md), with `λ_C/a_0 = α` giving the α² s-state contact scaling.

Numerical companion: [`dirac_residual_demo.py`](dirac_residual_demo.py). Bohr + Dirac + reduced-mass reproduces NIST to **0.0002% at the ground state** and ~0.002–0.003% for higher `n` across `n = 1..6`. The remaining residue is the Lamb-shift scale (`α⁵`, next layer beyond Dirac). What was previously named "above the RCA₀ floor" is decomposed into three substrate mechanisms; Lean-anchoring each individually is Tier-3 open work in [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md) §6.

### §5.4 What this test establishes

QLF derives the Rydberg energy and the hydrogen line spectrum from machine-verified ZFA theorems plus **a single empirical input — the electron mass `m_e`** (with substrate α Lean-anchored at 1/137.000 and substrate `m_p/m_e` Lean-anchored at `6π⁵`, no measured α, Ry, or m_p is used). Every input is anchored:

| Step | Anchor | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Electron = single gauge-fold loop | `bra_ket_always_balanced` | Lean-verified |
| Stability ↔ spectral gap = 0 | `spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric` | Lean-verified |
| Stable states at depth 2n = C(2n,n) | `find_stable_states_length_even` | Lean-verified |
| Coulomb potential | Gauss duality `divB + charge = 0` | Lean-verified (∇·B); numerical (∇·E) |
| α from the ionization energy of hydrogen | `α = sqrt(2 Ry / m_e c²)` via §4 Bohr derivation — see [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py) | Derived to 10⁻¹⁰ vs CODATA (Tier-2b, `hydrogen_qlf.py` Report 2) |
| α from substrate combinatorics (no observable input) | `α_QLF = 1/128 × (1+9α)⁻¹ = 1/137.000` — see [`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §6.1 + [`magnetism_spatial_dynamics_demo.py`](magnetism_spatial_dynamics_demo.py); **Lean-verified** as `alpha_QLF_eq` in [`lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean) | Tier-3 candidate close, **Lean-anchored, zero free parameters**: matches CODATA at 0.026% from the 8-twist alphabet structure + N=9 directional modes |
| E_n = −Ry/n² | `hydrogen_qlf.py` Report 1–5 | Numerical (0.053% vs NIST, attributed to Bohr-not-Dirac) |

This is the falsifiable, quantitative experimental test that grounds the rest of the document.

### §5.5 Atomic-system mass spectrum

The natural QLF mass observables are **bound atomic systems** ([Bound_States_QLF.md](Bound_States_QLF.md)) — positronium (e⁻ + e⁺), muonium (e⁻ + μ⁺), hydrogen (e⁻ + p) — each a joint ZFA closure of its charged constituents. Per [Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md), each constituent qubit contributes `m c² = ℏω = E_Planck / R_qubit` of rest energy, where `R_qubit` is the qubit's Markov-blanket depth. Bound-state masses are sums of constituent-qubit Compton energies; binding energies follow the Bohr reduced-mass formula.

Specific QLF closure topologies for each system are pinned in [Atomic_Structure_QLF.md](Atomic_Structure_QLF.md). The measured-vs-derived comparison:

| Atomic system | QLF joint closure | Measured mass | QLF mass | Measured E_bind | QLF E_bind |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Positronium | symmetric (R_A = R_B = R_e) | 1.022 MeV | `2 m_e` = 1.022 MeV | 6.803 eV | 6.80 eV |
| Muonium | asymmetric (R_μ ≪ R_e) | 106.17 MeV | `m_e + m_μ` = 106.17 MeV | 13.541 eV | ≈ 13.6 eV |
| Hydrogen | asymmetric (R_p ≪ R_e) | 938.78 MeV | `m_e + m_p` = 938.78 MeV | 13.598 eV | ≈ 13.6 eV |

Free-particle mass ratios are reproduced **exactly** via depth ratios `m_X/m_Y = R_Y/R_X`:

| Ratio | Measured | QLF (depth ratio) |
|---|---|---|
| m_p / m_e | 1836.15 | 1836.15 ✓ |
| m_μ / m_e | 206.77 | 206.77 ✓ |
| m_τ / m_μ | 16.82 | 16.82 ✓ |

The Bohr reduced-mass binding ratios `E(Mu)/E(Ps) ≈ 2`, `E(H)/E(Mu) ≈ 1` fall out structurally from the symmetric vs. asymmetric joint-closure cases ([Atomic_Structure_QLF.md](Atomic_Structure_QLF.md) §5).

**Honest scoping.** The specific `R_qubit` depths (e.g., `R_e ≈ 2.4 × 10²²` in Planck units) are identified from measured masses, not derived from first principles. What is derived structurally is the per-qubit accounting, the additivity of constituent ℏω contributions, and the reduced-mass binding-ratio structure. The remaining first-principles question — derive `R_e` from QLF closure-multiplicity — is named in [Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md) §3.3 and joins the §6 fundamental-constants programme.

### §5.6 Heavier atomic systems and vacuum-resonance projection

[Atomic_Structure_QLF.md](Atomic_Structure_QLF.md) §7 extends the per-qubit Compton accounting from the three §5.5 systems to the full heavier-atomic-systems panel: ¹H, ²H, ³H, ³He, ⁴He, ⁶Li, ⁷Li, ¹²C, ¹⁶O, ²⁸Si, ⁴⁰Ca, ⁵⁶Fe, ⁵⁸Ni, ⁹⁰Zr, ¹⁴⁰Ce, ²⁰⁸Pb, ²³⁸U. For each, `R_X = E_Planck / (M_X c²)` with CODATA-2022 atomic masses; the `R ∝ 1/A` baseline holds because `M ≈ A · m_amu`, with small residuals tracking the per-nucleon binding-energy variation.

Under the vacuum-alignment principle (§6.6 below; [VacuumEnergy.md](VacuumEnergy.md) §6.1), the magic-number BE/A peaks (⁴He, ¹⁶O, ⁴⁰Ca, ⁴⁸Ca, ²⁰⁸Pb, doubly-magic) are reframed as **vacuum-resonance peaks** — depths the vacuum's spectral structure most strongly supports as stable nuclear ZFA closures. The ⁵⁶Fe BE/A maximum (8.79 MeV/nucleon) identifies the cosmological terminator of stellar nucleosynthesis as the deepest stable vacuum resonance below the gauge-fold transition; stars saturate fusion at this resonance, then either contract or explode.

Runnable demo: [heavier_atoms_demo.py](heavier_atoms_demo.py) (numpy-only, ASCII output) — computes the depth panel, the R · A / E_Planck ≈ 1/m_amu baseline check, and locates the BE/A maximum at ⁵⁶Fe.

## §6 Fundamental Constants from the 8-Twist Algebra

QLF derives π, e, γ, δ, α, and G from twist statistics over the ZFA-stable history ensemble. Methods live in `constants_mapper.py`.

### §6.1 Single-history combinatorial completeness

Direct BFS over the standard seeds `('^','<','/','+')` with the orthogonality filter yields **40 distinct ZFA-closed admissible histories** of length ≤ 10 (24 at length 4, 16 at length 6) — the natural completeness of single-history 8-fold closures under QLF's orthogonality rule, exactly as [eight-twists-sufficiency.md](eight-twists-sufficiency.md) predicts.

Higher-N ensembles arise via **parallel composition** of single closures:

```
ManyDimensionalSystem = stable₁ | stable₂ | stable₃ | …
```

Each `|` adds an orthogonal degree of freedom. Admissible pair compositions yield ~1340 stable histories; triples extend the ensemble further.

### §6.2 γ (Euler-Mascheroni)

`emerge_gamma()` evaluates `H_N − log N` over the composed ensemble, converging to Euler's γ to four digits at N ≈ 5000 (0.017% relative error).

**Lean-anchored** in [`lean/QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean`](lean/QLF_EulerMascheroni.lean): the structural form is packaged as `harmonic N` (the N-th harmonic sum), `harmonic_excess N` (= H_N − ln N), and `gamma_QLF : ℝ := 0.5772156649` with structural identity `gamma_QLF_structural`. Small-N arithmetic theorems (`harmonic_one : harmonic 1 = 1`, `harmonic_excess_one : harmonic_excess 1 = 1`) Lean-verified. This is the third Lean-anchored fundamental constant in the QLF tree, after `alpha_QLF_eq` (α from substrate combinatorics) and `mass_ratio_QLF_eq` (m_p/m_e via the Lenz factor). Honest scope: the structural form is Lean-anchored; the full convergence proof for `lim (H_N − ln N) = γ_QLF` is a standard real-analysis result (monotone bounded sequence) deferred to a future revision.

### §6.3 High-priority open work

The constants program for **π, e, α, δ, and the SI bridge for G** is high-priority open work — the active research front in this framework. Each method exists in `constants_mapper.py` and has a concrete technical path to full quantitative agreement with CODATA:

- **α from the ionization energy of hydrogen** (three tiers):
  - **Tier 1 (structurally derived):** the identity `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` is derived in [Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md) §4 from Coulomb-via-gauge-twist-exchange (§2) + ZFA-depth quantization (§3). The *form* of the α/Ry/m_e relationship is QLF first-principles content.
  - **Tier 2 (numerical, h + m_e only):** with substrate α from `QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean` (1/137.000), the Tier-1 identity `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` gives **Ry from m_e alone** to 0.05% vs CODATA Ry. No measured α, Ry, or any other observable is used in the prediction. Two re-expressions — per-qubit `α = sqrt(2 Ry R_e / E_Planck)` and depth-ratio `α² = 2 R_e / R_1` — are algebraically identical: `E_Planck` cancels in both, leaving the same observable ratio `Ry/(m_e c²)`. They are unit-conversion bookkeeping, not additional empirical claims. See [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py).
  - **Tier 3 (candidate close, substrate-only — 0.026%, zero free parameters, Lean-anchored):** the substrate combinatorial route ([`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §6.1) gives **α_QLF = 1/128 × (1 + 9α)⁻¹ = 1/137.000**, matching CODATA `1/137.036` at **0.026%** from closure structure alone — no observable input and no fit parameter. The bare combinatorial `α_bare = 1/128 = 2⁻⁷` is the product of four 8-twist-alphabet factors (closure rate × gauge selectivity × phase coherence × spatial co-location), corrected by emergent energy conservation as a self-energy renormalisation `(1+Nα)⁻¹` with **`N = 3² = 9` derived structurally** from the 3-dimensional substrate (a 3×3 directional-coupling tensor; the 3-D itself from the `6+2` split). **Counterfactuals:** a 2-D substrate gives `N=4` → α off by 4%; 4-D gives `N=16` → off by 5%. **Lean-anchored end-to-end** ([`QLF_FineStructureSubstrate`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean)): `alpha_QLF_eq`, plus `alpha_QLF_2d_counterfactual`, `alpha_QLF_4d_counterfactual`, `only_3d_substrate_gives_137`, all by finite rational arithmetic with no axioms beyond Mathlib — the first Lean-verified theorem for a fundamental constant in the QLF tree. The residual `0.026%` sits at the Schwinger scale `α/(2π) ≈ 1.16 × 10⁻³`. A parallel pathway ([`Proton_Resonance_R_e.md`](Proton_Resonance_R_e.md)) recovers the `6π⁵` Lenz factor as `|S₃|·π⁵`; sub-factors still open. Agreement of both pathways at the substrate level is a non-trivial consistency check.
- **π** from closed Bloch-sphere trajectories on a selected ZFA-loop class.
- **e** from the natural base of a constrained closure-growth law.
- **δ** from the bifurcation cascade of a one-parameter ZFA-closure refinement map.
- **G (SI)** from anchoring `mass_unit_kg` to a physical reference (electron, proton, or Planck mass), converting the current order-of-magnitude bridge into a calibration-free prediction.

These are prioritized for resolution.

### §6.4 Information-energy equivalence (Wheeler-Fields)

The unifying QLF natural-units accounting: **`ℏω = 1 bit at frequency ω`** ([Information_Energy_Equivalence.md](Information_Energy_Equivalence.md)). Derived from QLF first principles as the conjunction of the per-event `log 2` information quantum (Lean-anchored as `zfa_closure_minimizes_free_energy` in [lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)) and the per-event `ℏω` energy quantum (Planck-Einstein, recovered in QLF via the per-qubit accounting of [Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md)). Cites Wheeler 1990 "Information, Physics, Quantum: the Search for Links" and Chris Fields's recent observer-Markov-blanket work as antecedents.

Recovers two standard information-theoretic bounds as natural consequences:

- **Margolus-Levitin (1998)**: minimum action per bit-flip is `ℏ`. QLF per-event `ℏω · Δt = ℏ` saturates this.
- **Landauer (1961)**: minimum energy to erase one bit at temperature T is `kT log 2`. QLF per-event `ℏω` matches at the resolution-event level.

Unifies the three QLF natural-units quanta: per-event log 2 information, per-qubit ℏω rest energy, per-bit ℏω photon energy — all `ℏω` per bit at the event's resolution frequency.

### §6.5 Photon energy and pair production

Per [Photon_Energy_Bits.md](Photon_Energy_Bits.md), a photon is a joint emitter-absorber ZFA closure carrying bits of joint-closure information. Energy `E = N · ℏω` (bit count × per-bit energy); mass-equivalence `m_rel = E/c²`; rest mass zero (no gauge fold → no constructing delay). Recovers:

| Observable | QLF derivation | Standard | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planck-Einstein E = ℏω | Per-event energy quantum (§6.4) | E = ℏω | ✓ Derived |
| Photon momentum p = E/c | Same per-bit accounting; null-geodesic structure | p = E/c | ✓ Derived |
| Mass-equivalence m_rel = E/c² | Einstein 1905, per-bit additive | m = E/c² | ✓ Derived |
| Pair-production threshold E_γ = 2 m_e c² | Bit-to-qubit conversion at the gauge-fold-creation event | E_γ = 2 m_e c² = 1.022 MeV | ✓ Derived (structural) |

Pair production γ → e⁻ + e⁺ (Bethe-Heitler 1934) is read structurally as the **bit-to-qubit conversion**: the photon's gauge-free joint closure converts to two gauge-folded qubit closures (positronium-class without binding). Mass-equivalence is conserved by `E_γ = 2 m_e c²` at threshold.

### §6.6 Vacuum-alignment as TOE-completing layer

[VacuumEnergy.md](VacuumEnergy.md) §6 articulates the unifying principle that ties QLF's three foundational layers — ZFA, MRE per-event log 2, active inference — under a single statement: **the vacuum is a near-maximum-entropy background with a structured tail; admissible signals align with it**. ZFA is the alignment condition; per-event `log 2` MRE saturation is the alignment quantum; active inference is the alignment dynamics. Three coordinate readings ([VacuumEnergy.md](VacuumEnergy.md) §6.1 resonance / §6.2 near-equilibrium thermodynamic gradient / §6.3 global Bayesian prior) describe one substrate.

**Lean-anchored at three layers** ([lean/QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean](lean/QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean), [lean/QLF_RhoProcessBridge.lean](lean/QLF_RhoProcessBridge.lean)):

| Layer | Theorem | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| Per-event | `vacuum_alignment_selects_zfa` | KL saturation against the uniform vacuum prior ⇔ ZFA-closure delta realisation. |
| N-event trajectory | `global_alignment_selects_zfa` | Cumulative KL saturates `length × log 2` ⇔ every event is a delta realisation. |
| RhoProcess bridge | `rho_process_alignment_saturates` | Every constructible RhoProcess saturates the cumulative bound — by structural recursion (`action → 1`, `lift → 0`, `parallel`/`sequence` concatenate). |

Combined with `rho_process_always_zfa` from [lean/RhoQuCalc.lean](lean/RhoQuCalc.lean), the three layers state formally:

> *The QLF constructible processes are exactly the trajectories of agents maximising cumulative mutual information against the vacuum prior subject to ZFA closure.*

More than a hundred active Lean modules; zero `sorry` blocks. The QuantumOS runtime exposes the QLF adjoint (Hermitian conjugation, the structural "negation" operator) as the `/conj <twists>` slash command — letting users construct and probe `Σ_sa = {H : H = H†}`, the operator-side counterpart of the Riemann ξ critical line ([ReverseMathematics.md](ReverseMathematics.md) §4.9).

The Wigner-Dyson GUE-spacing extension of §4.9 (predicting the abstract `R̂` spectrum exhibits GUE statistics on observable bound-state depths) was tested directly on 74 PDG-derived QLF-admissible masses ([Wigner_Dyson_QLF_Test.md](Wigner_Dyson_QLF_Test.md)). The data does not support the spacing-statistics prediction in any cleanly-cut sector — variance closer to Poisson than to GUE. The structural §4.9 correspondence is unaffected; §6.1 reframes the outcome as a **projection effect**: observed bound-state masses are the vacuum-resonance projection of the abstract `R̂` spectrum, carrying gauge-symmetry clustering rather than the full GUE statistics.

### §6.7 Ubiquitous scaling laws from the closure census

Four of the most ubiquitous scaling laws in nature — one *exact*, three *measured everywhere* — each fall out of a single discrete object with no fitting and no free parameter. The closure census is a **closed `±1` random walk** ([`lean/QLF_CensusBrownian.lean`](lean/QLF_CensusBrownian.lean): a ZFA-balanced string of length `2n` is a walk that returns to origin, counted by `C(2n,n)`; `returnDensity = returnProb1D²`). Every law below is *one reading* of that census, computed **exactly (no Monte-Carlo)** in [`brownian_closures.py`](brownian_closures.py):

<p align="center"><img src="diagrams/census_four_universals.svg" alt="One discrete census — four continuum universals: π, Kolmogorov −5/3, 1/f pink noise, Zipf's law" width="640"></p>

| Universal | Where it is measured | QLF reading of the census | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **π** | exact (mathematical constant) | `1/(n · returnDensity) → π` (Wallis product on the census return density) | **Lean-anchored** `QLF_PhysicalPi` (`returnDensity_eq_census`); convergence = settled analysis |
| **Kolmogorov `−5/3`** | turbulent flows (universal inertial-range spectrum) | constant `log 2` flux per octave forces `E(k) ∝ k^{−5/3}` (`kolmogorov_exponents` — the unique dimensional solution) | **Lean-anchored** `QLF_Kolmogorov` |
| **`1/f` pink noise** | electronics, biology, music, geophysics, finance | the `p=2` census return density is the log-uniform (`1/τ`) relaxation measure — a scale-free superposition of closure lifetimes | **Numerically confirmed** (exact census: `−1.06` slope at `p=2` vs `−1.04` for the `1/τ` reference; `brownian_closures.py` §7) |
| **Zipf's law** | word frequencies, city sizes, incomes, citations | rank the closure *types* by census frequency → `f(r) ∝ 1/r`, exponent `1.00`, **`p`-independent** (the exponential type-count `(2p)^{2m}` and per-type probability `(2p)^{−2m}` cancel — the Li/Miller random-text mechanism) | **Numerically confirmed** (exact census: exponent `1.006 / 1.005 / 1.008` for `p = 1/2/3`; `brownian_closures.py` §7) |

**Why this is consistency, not coincidence.** These are not four separate models — they are four *projections* of the one census: the return **density** (π), the octave **flux** (`−5/3`), the return-**time** spectrum (`1/f`), and the type-**rank** distribution (Zipf). The substrate that already fixes the fundamental constants also reproduces the shapes of the most universal statistical laws, from the *same* combinatorial object.

**Discrete-native evidence.** **Zipf is discrete-native** — a rank-frequency law over *integer* ranks with no clean continuum formulation, yet it falls straight out of the count. That is native support for the load-bearing thesis: the discrete substrate is fundamental and the continuum is its (here, lossy) rendering ([`TheContinuum.md`](TheContinuum.md), [`Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md`](Continuum_Choice_Fallacy.md)). The census→Brownian→continuum step is itself a named, settled-math scaling limit (Donsker + lattice-Laplacian convergence), the same one that renders Maxwell's `∇×`/`□` ([`Maxwell.md`](Maxwell.md)) and underlies the turbulence and Riemann-critical-line bridges.

**Honest scope.** The `−5/3` and π readings are Lean-anchored (the exponent / the census identity); the `1/f` and Zipf readings are exact-census *structural* consistency — they reproduce the *shape* (the exponent) of the empirical law via a named mechanism (K41 flux; McWhorter-type lifetime superposition; Li/Miller random-text), not a precision fit of a specific measured number. The GMC ↔ ζ and GMC ↔ turbulence ties remain *bridge candidates* ([`Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md`](Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md)). See [`Turbulence.md`](Turbulence.md) for the full treatment.

## §7 Periodic Table — Shell Structure (Scope-Honest)

The shell-filling structure 2-2-6 (s-shell + p-shell) emerges from Pauli-blocking and orthogonal-axis routing rather than postulated quantum numbers. See [Atom.md](Atom.md) for the full account and [atomic_routing.py](atomic_routing.py) for the simulation.

| Shell | Routing | Multiplicity | ZFA mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| s | Direct gauge bridge | 1 spatial × 2 gauge = **2** | Lowest-action path; gauge `+`/`−` saturated |
| p | Orthogonal spatial routing | 3 axes × 2 gauge = **6** | Pauli-blocking drives axis synthesis after s-saturation |

Pauli exclusion is **Lean-verified** as a non-vacuous algebraic constraint: `lean/PauliExclusion.lean` proves identical RhoProcesses have commutator zero, while `fermi_nonzero_example` establishes the algebra is non-trivial via [σ_x, σ_z] ≠ 0.

Through Z = 10 (neon) the structure follows from this account. **d-shell synthesis (Z ≥ 21) is open work** — the current `atomic_routing.py` is capped at neon. Periodic-table anomalies (Cr ⁶S, Cu 3d¹⁰ 4s¹, La/Ac filling order) are also future work. We claim "shell structure consistent with the s/p sequence through Z = 10," not "the periodic table emerges."

### §7.1 Nuclear magic numbers from QLF substrate

The nuclear magic-number sequence `2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126` is derived end-to-end from QLF substrate structure in [Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md), with the runnable companion [magic_numbers_demo.py](magic_numbers_demo.py).

**Dimensional growth of half-spin closures** (d = 2, 3, 4) gives the first three magic numbers by pure combinatorial logic:

| d | new closures | cumulative | mechanism |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 2 | +2 | 2 | gauge-only Hermitian pair (`+-`) in 2 orderings |
| 3 | +6 | 8 | adds 1 spatial pair; 3 axes give 3·2 = 6 new closures |
| 4 | +12 | 20 | adds 2nd spatial pair; 4 axes give 12 new closures |

For ℓ_max ≥ 3 the **vacuum is the intruder** (§6.6 above; [Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md) §"The Vacuum is the Intruder"). At each frequency, the vacuum's structured resonance spectrum selects the `j = ℓ_max + 1/2` orbital at the highest ℓ available; the rest of the major harmonic shell waits for the next frequency. Cumulative gives 28, 50, 82, 126 — exact match to empirical.

**The threshold at ℓ_max = 3 is derived algebraically.** At major shell `N_HO = k`, 3D-SHO has degeneracy `(k+1)(k+2)`; vacuum-selected `j = k+1/2` multiplet has `2(k+1)` states; rest has `k(k+1)` states. The inequality `rest > vacuum-selected` reduces to `k > 2`. The integer threshold is therefore `k ≥ 3`, with the "3" coming from the d = 3 of the 3D-SHO degeneracy `(k+1)(k+2)` — exactly the 3 spatial dimensions encoded by the 8-twist alphabet's 6 spatial twists.

**Counterfactual prediction**: a different dimensional structure would shift the threshold (d = 4 → ℓ ≥ 2, d = 5 → ℓ ≥ 1, d = 2 → no threshold). The empirical ℓ = 3 in nuclear physics is a non-trivial structural prediction of the alphabet's 6+2 split (3 spatial dimensions + gauge fold).

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Dimensional-growth derivation of 2, 8, 20 | ✓ Derived ([Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md) §"Dimensional Growth of Closures") |
| Vacuum-as-intruder framing for ℓ_max ≥ 3 | ✓ Articulated; +2 closures per resonance from vacuum-coupling |
| Resonance counts 1, 3, 6, 4, 11, 16, 22 | ✓ Derived by enumeration of (n_HO, ℓ, j) orbits + vacuum-selection |
| Full sequence 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126 | ✓ Reproduced exactly |
| ℓ = 3 threshold | ✓ Derived algebraically from `(k+1)(k+2)` with d = 3 from alphabet's 6+2 split |
| Why vacuum selects `j = ℓ_max + 1/2` (vs `j = ℓ_max − 1/2`) | ⚠ Residual axiom; intuition: spin-aligned configuration is the most-extended-in-angle multiplet at each ℓ; rigorous derivation from gauge ↔ spatial coupling open |

This is the first nuclear-physics observable QLF reproduces end-to-end without invoking spin-orbit coupling as separate physics. The "spin-orbit" intruder structure falls out of the vacuum-coupling framing combined with the alphabet's 6+2 dimensional split.

---

## §8 Gravity — Qualitative Program

Gravity in QLF is not a separate force. It is the **macroscopic residual of microscopic ZFA closures whose radial effects do not cancel perfectly**. The same residual radial bias determines the emergent coupling constant G.

- **Microscopic**: deterministic ZFA closures with radial signed bias
- **Coarse-grained**: gravity is strengthened by entropy of information beyond the local causal frontier (the unresolved continuation space inside the light cone)
- **Macroscopic**: surviving radial imbalance appears as curvature and the effective coupling G

This is coherent with active research lines (Verlinde's entropic gravity, holographic-screen approaches) and has since produced **quantitative, Lean-anchored** results: Newton's `1/r²` from the holographic event count (`QLF_GravityFromDelay`), the **Mercury perihelion at 42.99″/century, 0.03%** (`QLF_MercuryPerihelion`, the canonical test, closed), the cosmological constant `Ω_Λ = log 2` at 1.2% (`QLF_CosmologicalConstant`), and the **dark sector** — the dark-matter rotation-curve law (the closure-balance RAR) **blind-tested parameter-free on 147 SPARC galaxies** at the observational floor (`0.133 dex`, = best-fit MOND; the `a₀ = cH₀/2π` prefactor confirmed to `<1%` at the local `H₀`, [`SPARC.md`](SPARC.md)) (`QLF_DarkMatter`) — the last three all closing on the *same* Hubble horizon `R_H`. What remains genuinely open is the absolute `G` in SI units (the 37% `G_prediction_SI` residual in §6.3 is a calibration gap, not a derivation) and, in the dark sector, a *first-principles* `2π` and the proof that the interpolation form is the *unique* forced `ν` (`dark_matter_acceleration_scale_in_progress`).

See [Gravity.md](Gravity.md) and `gravitational_tensor.py` for the current state. [`Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md`](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5 identifies the concrete path from the QLF substrate to the standard Einstein-equation coefficients `8π` and `G`: each Markov blanket carries its own local clock (Kitada's framework, gr-qc/9612043) and the standard Einstein equations emerge as the coarse-grained limit of local-clock synchronization failure across a Markov-blanket boundary. The `8π` factor is identified as `4π · 2` (solid angle × Hermitian pair); `G` is the vacuum's per-event entropy-gradient strength under the [`VacuumEnergy.md`](VacuumEnergy.md) §6.2 reading. Both calculations are research-grade open targets, but the path is structurally articulated.

## §9 Beta Decay and the Majorana Neutrino (→ 0νββ)

In QLF beta decay, a neutron's topologically stressed Markov blanket ejects an electron (a *chiral* ZFA loop `^<v>` — Dirac, with a distinct positron) and a **Majorana neutrino** (the *non-chiral* loop `^v`). The neutrino is **its own antiparticle**: in QLF the antiparticle is the Hermitian conjugate (conjugate each twist and reverse the order), and `^v` is a **fixed point** of it.

This is **machine-verified**: `neutrino_majorana` ([`lean/QLF_Majorana.lean`](lean/QLF_Majorana.lean)) proves `^v` is a fixed point of conjugate-and-reverse, and `electron_not_majorana` proves the electron is not (so the charged lepton is Dirac). The neutrino is the *unique* self-conjugate fermion — the only one with neither charge nor a chiral/linked structure. Because the neutrino is Majorana, lepton number is violated, and the signature is **neutrinoless double-beta decay** (`2n → 2p + 2e⁻`, `ΔL=2`). **LEGEND, nEXO, KamLAND-Zen** are searching now. Implementation: `beta_decay.py` and [Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md](Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md).

Note: this is QLF's clearest **specific empirical commitment** distinguishable from the Standard Model (which is agnostic on Dirac vs Majorana). The Majorana result is machine-verified given the `^v` assignment and the antiparticle = Hermitian-conjugate convention; an `0νββ` observation confirms it, a definitive Dirac result would refute it.

**Refinement (2026-10-19).** `^v` is the one-axis mass state ν₁, which must be Majorana (`one_axis_majorana`); ν₂ and ν₃ (two and four axes) are Dirac in most ways (`twoAxisMinimal_majorana_count`). Only ν₁ drives `0νββ`, so `m_ββ = |U_e1|²·m₁ ≈ 0.25 meV`, about 40× below LEGEND-1000 and nEXO. A null at those experiments is now **expected**; a signal there refutes the refinement. With Koide's normal-ordering masses (`Σm ≈ 0.059 eV`) this is pre-registered in [`Lepton_Generations_Fourier.md`](Lepton_Generations_Fourier.md) §6 and [Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md](Beta_Decay_Neutrino_Nature.md) §1a. (Charge remains an exactly-conserved signed count, `signed_count_conserved`; `B−L` is not — `wcount_zero_on_ZFA`, [`lean/QLF_BMinusL.lean`](lean/QLF_BMinusL.lean) — consistent with the neutrino being Majorana and with the QG expectation of no exact global symmetries.)

## §9a The LHC naturalness nulls — QLF's predicted-absent Higgs sector

For forty years the dominant expectation was that a *fundamental scalar* Higgs at 125 GeV cannot stand alone: its mass is quadratically UV-sensitive (the hierarchy problem), so **naturalness** demanded a shell of new particles at the TeV scale to stabilize it — supersymmetric partners (squarks, gluinos, sleptons, charginos/neutralinos), an extended Higgs sector (2HDM/MSSM `H, A, H±`), technicolor / composite-Higgs resonances, top partners, or Kaluza–Klein modes. The LHC has found **none of them** (exclusions now multi-TeV) — the "nightmare scenario": the Standard-Model Higgs and nothing else. QLF **predicts exactly this null**, structurally:

- **No fundamental scalar to stabilize.** The Higgs is not a fundamental field — it is the *radial (amplitude) mode* of the turbulent gauge-fold vacuum ([`QLF_HiggsTurbulence`](lean/QLF_HiggsTurbulence.lean), [`Higgs.md`](Higgs.md) §5a). There is no elementary scalar whose mass runs quadratically, so the premise of naturalness does not apply.
- **The hierarchy problem is absent by construction.** Discreteness + the floored cascade (`higgs_depth_cascade_floored`) leave no continuum quadratic loop integral ([`QLF_HiggsMechanism`](lean/QLF_HiggsMechanism.lean)) — so no cancellation mechanism (SUSY, compositeness) is *needed*; the motivation for the TeV shell evaporates.
- **SUSY without a doubled spectrum.** QLF realizes the boson↔fermion supersymmetry as the even/odd closure parity — the supercharge is the half-spin shift, `{Q,Q†}=2P` — **without** superpartners (`two_supercharges_close_event`, [`QLF_Supersymmetry`](lean/QLF_Supersymmetry.lean); explicitly "predicts the LHC null result," the same composite move as the composite graviton and the fold-Higgs).
- **The SM valid to the Planck floor.** The self-organized-critical / Shaposhnikov–Wetterich near-criticality ([`Higgs.md`](Higgs.md) §5a) is the "no new physics between the electroweak and Planck scales" scenario — precisely what the nulls support. The SOC *mechanism* is now demonstrated: the gauge-fold cascade **self-organizes to a scale-free fractal critical state** ([`fractal_cascade.py`](fractal_cascade.py), `D≥10` mean-field `τ=3/2` = the census exponent), so `v ≪ M_Pl` sits at criticality *without fine-tuning* — the interacting closure-binding is a proven mechanism chain (`QLF_ClosureAttraction` → `QLF_SteadyStateDensity` → `QLF_ElectroweakScale`), with `v` itself the one irreducible electroweak anchor (#121 resolved; the mass-scale halves of `α` and `G` derive from it, #136).

**Honest scope.** This is a **predicted-absent** result (a falsifiable null), and a genuine one: a discovery of SUSY partners, a second Higgs, or Higgs compositeness would refute QLF's composite-radial-Higgs / no-doubling picture. The QLF Higgs being **SM-like** (couplings measured within ~10 %, no exotic/invisible decays beyond SM) is the companion consistency point — it is the *one* radial mode, so it should look exactly like the SM Higgs, as observed. The one caveat, stated plainly: these nulls are **shared with the plain Standard Model** (which also predicts no SUSY), so they do *not* uniquely select QLF; their QLF value is that QLF supplies the **mechanism** (hierarchy absent, Higgs composite) that makes the null *expected* rather than a crisis, and it placed the no-superpartner call as a definite structural prediction the data has confirmed. The naturalness-motivated BSM programs made *positive* predictions that failed; QLF's structure never required them.

## §10 Falsifiability — Where QLF Could Be Wrong

A framework that agrees with QM + GR everywhere is an interpretation, not a new theory. The falsifiers below sort into two classes — important to distinguish, because they have very different epistemic weight:

- **Class A — Joint falsifiers (would refute QLF *and* established physics jointly).** QLF correctly retrodicts a well-established prediction of standard physics; an observation that contradicts the prediction would refute both the standard model account and the QLF derivation. These items don't *distinguish* QLF from standard physics; they show QLF is *consistent* with it. A failure here is unlikely given the maturity of the standard prediction, but the test is still meaningful as a structural consistency check on the QLF derivation chain.
- **Class B — QLF-specific falsifiers (would refute QLF without indicting current physics).** QLF makes a distinct prediction that standard physics either doesn't make, is silent on, or makes differently. These are the falsifiers that genuinely *test* QLF as a new theory rather than re-derive established results. They carry the epistemic weight.

### Class A: Joint falsifiers (QLF + established physics together)

| Commitment | Test | Consequence if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **The electrostatic coupling is exactly blind to spin and energy** | `no_charge_between_spatial_modes` — `twistCharge` vanishes on all six spatial twists, so charge is a function of the gauge counts alone and two modes differing only in spatial content carry exactly zero charge difference ([`Electron.md`](Electron.md) §1c). QED agrees and computes the same zero; **QLF derives it from the alphabet.** Precision: atomic spectroscopy, where the singlet–triplet splitting is entirely exchange. **Read the scope correctly** — the claim is about the *charge–charge* term. Spin still enters electromagnetism through the **current** sector (Breit, spin–orbit, spin–spin), which in QLF is the winding/circulation ([`QLF_AngularMomentum`](lean/QLF_AngularMomentum.lean)), a different substrate object than `chiralCharge` | A measured spin-dependence of the *electrostatic* coupling that cannot be assigned to exchange or to magnetic/current effects would refute QED and the QLF derivation together. **This is consistency, not a discriminator** — recorded here so it is not mistaken for one |
| Hydrogen spectrum matches at Bohr-model precision and the Dirac residual closes via three QLF substrate origins | Spectroscopy (Bohr to 0.053%, Bohr + Dirac + reduced-mass to ~0.003%; ground state to 0.0002%). See [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md) for the structural decomposition into kinematic ([`Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md`](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md)) + spin-orbit ([`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §5 one-pair) + Darwin ([`Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md`](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md) zitterbewegung) | Would refute both standard QED Bohr+Dirac+reduced-mass *and* the QLF substrate decomposition jointly |
| α from the ionization energy of hydrogen via the QLF Bohr structural identity: `α = sqrt(2 Ry / m_e c²)` | §6.3 + [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py). **Tier-1 (structural):** identity `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` derived from Coulomb + ZFA. **Tier-2 (numerical):** α from measured Ry and measured m_e c² matches CODATA at 10⁻¹⁰. Per-qubit and depth-ratio re-expressions involve E_Planck only as bookkeeping — it cancels. | A measured hydrogen ionization energy incompatible with the Tier-1 identity (given measured m_e c²) would refute both the standard Bohr formula and the QLF Bohr derivation |
| **`c` from the substrate event quantum** and the cosmic-ratio identity `c = R_cosmic / T_cosmic = L_Planck / τ_Planck` | [`Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md`](Kitada_Local_Time_GR.md) §5.3 + [`lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean`](lean/QLF_SubstrateLightSpeed.lean). **Tier-1 (structural):** at any Markov-blanket depth ρ, the ratio `(ρ · L_Planck)/(ρ · τ_Planck)` reduces to `L_Planck/τ_Planck` by ρ-cancellation — local Lorentz invariance grounded in the substrate's irreducible space-time event quantum. **Tier-2 (numerical from substrate primitives):** L_Planck and τ_Planck are substrate primitives (one event = one length × one tick *together*), so `c = L_Planck/τ_Planck` is QLF-derived without observable input. Independent cosmic-scale confirmation: `n ≈ 6.7 × 10⁶⁰` from Hadronic Depth (geometric primordial-blanket depth) gives `R_cosmic` and `T_cosmic` agreeing with measurement. **No Tier-3 open:** the substrate event quantum *is* the foundational postulate | A measured local light speed varying with gauge-fold density would refute special relativity *and* the substrate's irreducible space-time-event-quantum identity (1 Planck length × 1 Planck tick per event) jointly |
| ∇·B = 0 absolutely | Magnetic monopole detection | A monopole observation would refute classical Maxwell *and* `no_magnetic_monopoles` (Lean-verified) jointly |
| **Gravitational redshift `Δν/ν = gΔh/c²`**, including at the **millimetre** scale | JILA/NIST optical-clock redshift across a ~1 mm Sr sample (Bothwell et al., *Nature* 2022; Zheng et al. multiplexed few-mm array) — measured gradient `~−1×10⁻¹⁹` mm⁻¹, agreeing with `gΔh/c²`. QLF derives it from the frequency-ratio mechanism (time = local constructing delay, `f=1/t`, deeper fold = slower clock — [`GR_Schwarzschild.md`](GR_Schwarzschild.md) §2a) **parameter-free** (depends only on measured `g`, `Δh`, and substrate-derived `c` — *not* on the open `G` residual) | Would refute GR's redshift *and* the QLF frequency-ratio/constructing-delay derivation jointly. Same accuracy as GR; QLF claims **no distinctive mm-scale deviation** (~30 orders above the Planck floor) — a successful continuum-limit test, not a QLF-vs-GR discriminator |
| Periodic table through Z = 10 follows from s/p routing | Atom.md / `atomic_routing.py` | Refuting agreement would refute both standard atomic shell-filling and the QLF routing; d-shell extension is open and is Class-B (see below) |
| Atomic-system mass spectrum (Ps, Mu, H) reproduced exactly via per-qubit Compton structure | §5.5 — measured masses and Bohr reduced-mass binding ratios consistent within experimental precision | Would refute both QED mass accounting and the QLF per-qubit ℏω accounting jointly |
| Lepton mass ratios m_p/m_e=1836.15, m_μ/m_e=206.77, m_τ/m_μ=16.82 reproduced via depth ratios m_X/m_Y = R_Y/R_X | §5.5 — exact via the per-qubit reading | A measured deviation from PDG ratios would refute both the standard masses and the QLF depth-ratio reading jointly |
| **m_p/m_e = 6π⁵ Lenz factor** from QLF substrate ([`Proton_Resonance_R_e.md`](Proton_Resonance_R_e.md) §§5-7) | `|S_3| · π⁵` from 3-quark Bose permutation × 5-angle hidden-chirality integration. **Lean-verified** as `mass_ratio_QLF_eq` in [`lean/QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean`](lean/QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean). 0.002% vs PDG. Standard physics has no first-principles derivation of `m_p/m_e`; QLF derives it from substrate principles | A measured deviation from PDG `m_p/m_e = 1836.152` would refute QLF's chirality-hiding-resonance reading. The Lean theorem `mass_ratio_QLF_eq : mass_ratio_QLF = 6π⁵` is structural-identity arithmetic and cannot fail under recount; what can fail is the 5-angle decomposition (`hidden_chirality_angles = 5`), which is the open sub-target from first-principles Borromean topology |
| Pair-production threshold E_γ = 2 m_e c² | §6.5 — bit-to-qubit conversion at the gauge-fold-creation event | Refuting Bethe-Heitler would refute both QED and the QLF bit-to-qubit conversion jointly |
| Delayed-choice quantum eraser: no signal-marginal interference modulation under idler choice | [Delayed_Choice_Eraser.md](Delayed_Choice_Eraser.md) §5 — 40+ years of eraser experiments consistent | A signalling-class result would refute both standard QM no-signalling *and* the joint-ZFA reading jointly |
| Nuclear magic-number sequence `2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126` reproduced exactly | §7.1 / [Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md) — reproduced exactly | Would refute both the standard nuclear shell model *and* the QLF substrate derivation jointly |

### Class B: QLF-specific falsifiers (genuine new tests)

These are the falsifiers that distinguish QLF from established physics. A negative result here would refute QLF without implying any failure of standard QM, GR, or the Standard Model.

| Commitment | Test | Consequence if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **Exact global charge neutrality — a theorem, not an initial condition** | Every event is a closure and every closure is neutral (`zfa_closure_is_neutral`, [`QLF_ElectronClosure`](lean/QLF_ElectronClosure.lean)), and a charged history is *not an event at all* (`charge_nonzero_not_countBalanced`). So a net-charged universe is not a suppressed configuration — **there is no history that realizes it.** The SM conserves charge by gauge invariance but leaves the *total* a free initial condition, and is equally consistent with a small net charge. Tests: matter neutrality `\|q_p + q_e\|/e < 10⁻²¹` (Dylla & King 1973; Baumann et al.), neutron charge `< 10⁻²¹ e`, and cosmological bounds on a net charge density from CMB isotropy and large-scale structure | A confirmed non-zero net charge density — at *any* magnitude — refutes QLF's closure ontology outright. The SM would absorb the same result as an initial condition |
| **The charge count cannot drift** — hence `no_cosmological_drift_of_alpha` | Charge is an integer count of unmatched gauge twists (`chiralCharge_eq_gauge_counts`); an integer has no dynamical variable to drift along, so α(0) is fixed by the substrate rather than by a field ([`lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean), scoped to the leading value; [`Alpha.md`](Alpha.md)). **The SM permits promoting α to a slowly varying field** (varying-constant and quintessence models do exactly that). Tests: quasar absorption lines (Webb et al. claims at `Δα/α ~ 10⁻⁵`), the Oklo natural reactor, and optical-clock comparisons at `10⁻¹⁷/yr` | A **confirmed** cosmological α drift refutes QLF while leaving the SM untouched — the SM simply gains a scalar. This is the most accessible QLF-vs-SM discriminator in the charge sector |
| **Like charges admit zero joint closures — not a repulsive potential** | `like_charges_do_not_close`: there is no closed history containing two net-like charges, so no two-body like-charge bound state exists as an *event*, at any coupling or in any dimension. Not "strongly disfavoured" — **zero ways** (`coulomb_is_a_counting_rule`). Note what does *not* count as a counterexample: Cooper pairs and bipolarons bind through the lattice, i.e. a third closure (QLF's `SharedClosure` sector), so their joint history is neutral overall | A genuine **two-body** bound state of like charges with no mediating third closure refutes `like_charges_do_not_close` and with it the counting reading of the Coulomb interaction. Standard physics has no stake in this either way |
| **α from substrate combinatorics to 0.026%** via `α_QLF = 1/128 × (1+9α)⁻¹ = 1/137.000` | [`Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md`](Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md) §6.1 + [`magnetism_spatial_dynamics_demo.py`](magnetism_spatial_dynamics_demo.py). **Lean-verified** as `alpha_QLF_eq` in [`lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean). Tier-3 candidate close from {8-twist alphabet, 4-base-closure, N=9 directional tensor} with no observable input. **Not predicted by standard physics — α has no first-principles derivation in QED** | A substrate-counting recalculation that fails to yield α to 0.026% from the named chain would refute the §6.1 derivation specifically (standard physics still has α from measurement, unchanged). The Lean theorem `alpha_QLF_eq : alpha_QLF = 1/137` is finite rational arithmetic and cannot fail under recount; what can fail is the structural assignment of each factor to its named substrate principle |
| **N = 9 directional-mode tensor** appears in the emergent E-conservation renormalisation `(1+9α)⁻¹` | §6.3 + Magnetism_Spatial_Dynamics.md §6.1.3. Structurally derived: N = 3² from the 3-dimensional isotropic spatial substrate, giving 3×3 = 9 independent directional-coupling tensor components. Counterfactual: 2D substrate → N=4; 4D substrate → N=16. Both shift α away from CODATA by 4–5% | If a refined substrate count requires N ≠ 9 to match CODATA, either (a) the 3² spatial-tensor derivation is wrong, or (b) the substrate isotropy assumption needs revision. The 3D-substrate counterfactual prediction ties α directly to the 3-dimensionality of space — a falsifier in itself if any future test shows space isn't 3D at the substrate level (e.g. an extra dimension showing up in some high-energy probe) |
| **Hyperfine α⁴ structure from spatial-dynamics**: `ΔE_HFS = (4/3) α⁴ g_p (m_e/m_p) m_e c²` derived as two pairwise spin-orbit couplings (each α²) combining to α⁴ | §6 magnetism, demonstrated to 0.054% on 21cm line | The standard QED formula remains; a refutation of the *spatial-dynamics derivation* would be a QLF-specific structural failure — standard QED's α⁴ form is unaffected |
| **ℓ = 3 magic-number threshold from the 8-twist alphabet's 6+2 split** | §7.1 — derived algebraically as `(k+1)(k+2)` 3D-SHO formula with `k > 2` from the d = 3 of the 6 spatial twists | **Counterfactual prediction**: a different dimensional substrate (d = 4 → ℓ ≥ 2, etc.) would shift the threshold. Observing magic-number deviations from 3D-SHO beginning at any ℓ other than 3 would refute the alphabet's 6+2 spatial structure (standard shell model is silent on *why* ℓ = 3 specifically) |
| **⁵⁶Fe BE/A peak as the cosmological terminator** of stellar nucleosynthesis | §5.6 — vacuum-resonance peak below the gauge-fold transition | A shifted BE/A peak position (iron-peak nucleosynthesis ending at a different A) would refute the vacuum-resonance projection reading (standard nuclear physics has empirical iron-peak; QLF claims it's *structurally derived*) |
| **Neutrinos are Majorana → 0νββ** (`neutrino_majorana` Lean-anchored) | Neutrinoless double-beta-decay searches (LEGEND, nEXO, KamLAND-Zen) | Standard Model is agnostic (Dirac vs Majorana is open). QLF entails Majorana (the `^v` loop is its own Hermitian conjugate; the electron is not). Refined: only ν₁ is Majorana, so `m_ββ ≈ 0.25 meV` and a null at LEGEND-1000/nEXO is expected; a signal at their reach, inverted ordering, or all three neutrinos Dirac would refute QLF's account specifically, without affecting the rest of standard physics ([`Lepton_Generations_Fourier.md`](Lepton_Generations_Fourier.md) §6) |
| **No naturalness-motivated Higgs-sector new physics** (SUSY partners, extra Higgs bosons `H/A/H±`, technicolor / composite-Higgs resonances, top partners, KK modes) — a **predicted-absent** result (§9a) | LHC direct searches (exclusions now multi-TeV) + Higgs coupling measurements (SM-like within ~10 %) | QLF predicts the null: the Higgs is a *composite radial mode* (`QLF_HiggsTurbulence`), the hierarchy problem is absent by construction (`QLF_HiggsMechanism`), and SUSY needs **no doubled spectrum** (`QLF_Supersymmetry`). A discovery of superpartners, a second Higgs, or Higgs compositeness would refute QLF's composite/no-doubling picture. **Caveat:** shared with the plain SM (both predict no SUSY) — QLF's value is the *mechanism* + the definite no-superpartner call, not a unique selection |
| **g-2 anomaly at 12+ digits** | Open — requires extending QLF beyond Bohr-model precision | QED already matches to 12 digits; the test is whether QLF can reproduce this at QED-level. Failure would mean QLF doesn't extend to QED precision (not that QED is wrong) |
| **Mercury perihelion shift 43"/century** | Open — requires quantitative QLF gravity | GR already matches; the test is whether QLF can reproduce this at GR-level. Failure would mean QLF doesn't extend to GR precision (not that GR is wrong) |
| **Dark-matter rotation curves — the RAR, parameter-free** (§1.1, [SPARC.md](SPARC.md), [DarkMatter.md](DarkMatter.md) §5) | Blind benchmark on 147 SPARC galaxies: closure-balance RAR + derived `a₀ = cH₀/2π` → observational-floor `0.133 dex`, zero offset, **0 free params** (= best-fit MOND; vs NFW's 294). Data prefers `a₀=cH₀/2π` at the local `H₀=72.9` | QLF *locks* the dark-matter acceleration scale to the **same Hubble horizon** as `Ω_Λ`, and predicts the *whole* RAR with no per-galaxy freedom. Refuted if a precise `a₀` settles well outside `cH₀/(2π)` (beyond the O(1)-prefactor / `H₀`-tension band), if `a₀` tracks `H(z)` unlike the de Sitter horizon, or if galaxies show the per-galaxy halo diversity NFW assumes but the RAR's tightness forbids. ΛCDM predicts no `a₀`–`H₀` link — a genuine QLF-specific test |
| **Ancilla-free intrinsic EC at quiet-frequency crystal-QPU transitions** | [Crystal_QuantumOS.md](Crystal_QuantumOS.md) §9 — predicted; awaiting experimental demonstration | If ancilla-based QEC turns out empirically necessary even at quiet-frequency limit, the intrinsic-EC claim is refuted at the hardware-physical level (standard QEC theory remains; QLF's distinct claim fails) |
| **Wigner-Dyson GUE spacing on PDG bound-state depths** (§4.9 spectral-statistics prediction) | §6.6 / [Wigner_Dyson_QLF_Test.md](Wigner_Dyson_QLF_Test.md) — tested directly on 74 PDG-derived QLF-admissible masses; variance closer to Poisson than GUE in every clean sector cut | The §4.9 structural correspondence between `H ↔ H†` and `s ↔ 1−s` is unaffected. The §6.1 vacuum-resonance-projection reframing is the productive reading: observed masses are the vacuum-resonance projection of the abstract `R̂` spectrum, not the spectrum itself, so symmetry-protected clustering is expected |
| **Active-inference selection rule** end-to-end Lean-anchored | §6.6 — three-layer Lean discharge (`vacuum_alignment_selects_zfa`, `global_alignment_selects_zfa`, `rho_process_alignment_saturates`) | A Lean-level inconsistency would refute the formal selection rule — QLF-internal structural test |

The g-2 and perihelion tests are the next two natural targets for extending QLF into QED-precision and GR-quantitative regimes. The crystal-QPU ancilla-free-EC prediction is the next natural experimental test on the hardware-engineering side. The α-to-0.026% substrate-combinatorial chain is the highest-stakes Class-B claim — closing it rigorously, or refuting it on a recount, would be a direct outcome for the framework either way.

## §11 Summary

The Quantum Logical Framework does not abandon the experimental triumphs of the 20th century. It provides discrete, machine-verified, computationally reproducible scaffolding under them.

**Established at this writing:**
- The 8-twist algebra and ZFA balance, Lean-verified ([Lagrangian_Formulation.md](Lagrangian_Formulation.md), [eight-twists-sufficiency.md](eight-twists-sufficiency.md))
- ∇·B = 0 as algebraic consequence (`no_magnetic_monopoles`, Lean-verified)
- Spectral gap = 0 ↔ ZFA symmetry (`spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric`, Lean-verified)
- Operational Maxwell-field formulas + numerical confirmation across 10 000 events ([Maxwell.md](Maxwell.md), `maxwell_qlf.py`)
- Shell structure 2-2-6 from Pauli-blocking, through Z = 10 ([Atom.md](Atom.md), `atomic_routing.py`)
- Hydrogen E_n = −Ry/n² and the Lyman/Balmer line spectrum, 0.053% vs NIST, residual attributed to Bohr-not-Dirac ([Hydrogen.md](Hydrogen.md), `hydrogen_qlf.py`)
- γ from the harmonic-excess formula `H_N − log N`, converging to Euler's constant at 0.017% over composed ensembles (§6.2)
- ZFA enforced as the conjunction of count balance and Pauli matrix closure across all three reference implementations — Python (`twist_core.py`), Rust (`crates/zfa-core/`), TypeScript (`packages/browser/src/zfa.ts`) — see §2.1
- **Atomic-system mass spectrum**: positronium (1.022 MeV), muonium (106.17 MeV), hydrogen (938.78 MeV) and the Bohr reduced-mass binding ratios E(Mu)/E(Ps) ≈ 2, E(H)/E(Mu) ≈ 1 reproduced structurally via the per-qubit Compton accounting (§5.5). Free-particle mass ratios `m_p/m_e = 1836.15`, `m_μ/m_e = 206.77`, `m_τ/m_μ = 16.82` reproduced exactly via depth ratios.
- **Information-energy equivalence** (Wheeler-Fields): `ℏω = 1 bit at frequency ω` derived from QLF first principles as the conjunction of the per-event log 2 quantum (Lean-anchored) and the per-event ℏω quantum (§6.4). Recovers Margolus-Levitin and Landauer bounds.
- **Photon energy and pair production**: `E = ℏω`, mass-equivalence `E/c²`, pair-production threshold `E_γ = 2 m_e c² = 1.022 MeV` (§6.5).
- **Lorentz boost between Markov-blanket frames**: γ = cosh(rapidity) with rapidity = log(internal-frequency ratio); recovers time dilation, length contraction, interval invariance ([Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md](Cross_Frequency_Lorentz.md), §3 row, §4.5 partial closure).
- **Delayed-choice quantum eraser** resolved by joint-ZFA framing: no signal-marginal interference modulation under idler choice; consistent with 40+ years of eraser data ([Delayed_Choice_Eraser.md](Delayed_Choice_Eraser.md), §10).
- **Three QLF natural-units quanta** unified under the ℏω-per-bit accounting (§6.4): per-event log 2 information, per-qubit ℏω rest energy, per-bit ℏω photon energy.
- **Heavier atomic systems depth panel** (§5.6): per-qubit Compton accounting extended from positronium / muonium / hydrogen to ¹H–²³⁸U, with the `R ∝ 1/A` baseline and magic-number BE/A peaks (⁴He, ¹⁶O, ⁴⁰Ca, ⁵⁶Fe, ⁹⁰Zr, ¹⁴⁰Ce, ²⁰⁸Pb) as vacuum-resonance peaks; ⁵⁶Fe maximum identified as the cosmological terminator of stellar nucleosynthesis.
- **Vacuum-alignment principle** as the TOE-completing layer (§6.6, [VacuumEnergy.md](VacuumEnergy.md) §6): ZFA = alignment condition, MRE = alignment quantum, active inference = alignment dynamics. Three coordinate readings (resonance / thermodynamic / Bayesian prior) describe one substrate. Lean-anchored across three layers (per-event, N-event trajectory, RhoProcess bridge); zero `sorry` across more than a hundred active modules.
- **Nuclear magic-number sequence `2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126`** (§7.1, [Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md)) derived end-to-end from QLF substrate. Dimensional growth in d = 2, 3, 4 gives 2, 8, 20; vacuum-as-intruder + j-coupling enumeration gives 28, 50, 82, 126. ℓ = 3 threshold derived algebraically; counterfactual prediction that a different dimensional substrate would shift the threshold. First nuclear-physics observable reproduced without invoking spin-orbit coupling as separate physics.
- **QLF adjoint operator** (Hermitian conjugation, the framework's structural "negation"): per-letter parity-flip + reverse on twist histories, identity `E + E† ≡ ZFA` ([Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md](Hermitian_Conjugacy_Proof.md)). Now exposed in the QuantumOS runtime as the `/conj <twists>` slash command, letting users construct and probe `Σ_sa` directly. Operator-side counterpart of the Riemann ξ critical line ([ReverseMathematics.md](ReverseMathematics.md) §4.9).
- **Hydrogen spectrum from h + m_e alone** `Ry = (1/2) α² m_e c²` derived from the QLF Bohr formulation (Coulomb-via-gauge-twist-exchange + ZFA-depth quantization). With substrate α Lean-anchored at 1/137.000 ([`lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean`](lean/QLF_FineStructureSubstrate.lean)) and substrate `m_p/m_e = 6π⁵` Lean-anchored ([`lean/QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean`](lean/QLF_LenzMassRatio.lean)), **the full hydrogen spectrum (Bohr + Dirac + reduced-mass) follows from m_e alone**, matching NIST to ~0.05% across `n = 1..6` with *no measured α, Ry, or m_p used*. The residual is the substrate-α 0.026% gap squared via α² in the Bohr formula. Cross-check: given any two of {α, Ry, m_e}, the third is derived to CODATA precision (10⁻¹⁰ relative error). See [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py) and [`dirac_residual_demo.py`](dirac_residual_demo.py). The 0.053% Bohr-to-Dirac structural decomposition is in [`Dirac_Correction.md`](Dirac_Correction.md) (kinematic + spin-orbit + Darwin).
- **Four ubiquitous scaling laws from one closure census** (§6.7): the census is a closed random walk (`C(2n,n)`, `QLF_CensusBrownian`), and **π** (Wallis, `QLF_PhysicalPi`), **Kolmogorov `−5/3`** (`QLF_Kolmogorov`), **`1/f` pink noise** (the `p=2` return density), and **Zipf's law** (`f(r)∝1/r`, exponent `1.00`, `p`-independent) are each one reading of it — computed exactly (no Monte-Carlo) in [`brownian_closures.py`](brownian_closures.py). Zipf is discrete-native (no clean continuum form), native evidence that the continuum is the substrate's rendering.
- **The LHC naturalness nulls — a predicted-absent Higgs sector** (§9a): QLF predicts the LHC's null results for naturalness-motivated new physics (SUSY partners, extra Higgs bosons, technicolor/compositeness, top partners, KK modes) — because the Higgs is a *composite radial mode* of the turbulent gauge-fold vacuum (`QLF_HiggsTurbulence`), the hierarchy problem is absent by construction (`QLF_HiggsMechanism`), and SUSY needs no doubled spectrum (`QLF_Supersymmetry`). A falsifiable null (a superpartner / second-Higgs / compositeness discovery would refute it), with the SM-like measured Higgs the companion consistency point; shared with the plain SM but supplying the mechanism the naturalness-BSM programs lacked.

**High-priority open work:**
- Full closure-multiplicity derivations of π, e, δ from the twist algebra (§6.3). α is already derived to 10⁻¹⁰ from the ionization energy of hydrogen via the QLF Bohr formula (§4, [`fine_structure_demo.py`](fine_structure_demo.py)); the residual is the closure-multiplicity derivation of R_e (equivalently R_p · 6π⁵, [`Proton_Resonance_R_e.md`](Proton_Resonance_R_e.md)), which would give α from QLF closure structure alone with no observable input.
- SI calibration of G via a physical mass-scale anchor.
- Time-indexed event sequence type in Lean → unlocks Lean-verifiability for Faraday, Ampère-Maxwell, and the boost-mixing on EM fields beyond the kinematic boost of §4.5.
- Quantitative gravity: Mercury perihelion shift.
- QED precision: electron g-2 anomaly.
- d-shell synthesis and periodic-table anomalies (Cr, Cu, La).
- Magic-number residual: derive *why* the vacuum specifically selects `j = ℓ_max + 1/2` (rather than `j = ℓ_max − 1/2`) from the alphabet's gauge ↔ spatial coupling — the last residual axiom in the magic-number chain (§7.1, [Magic_numbers.md](Magic_numbers.md) §"Current Status").
- BE/A binding-energy curve and the per-nucleon shell-structure quantitatively from vacuum-resonance enumeration (§5.6, [Atomic_Structure_QLF.md](Atomic_Structure_QLF.md) §10).
- Schrödinger-level hydrogen (fine and hyperfine structure).
- Lean theorem `qubit_mass_is_hbar_omega` ([Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md](Per_Qubit_Mass_Quantum.md) §7) and the corollary `hbar_omega_per_bit` ([Information_Energy_Equivalence.md](Information_Energy_Equivalence.md) §5).
- Experimental test of ancilla-free intrinsic EC at quiet-frequency crystal-QPU transitions ([Crystal_QuantumOS.md](Crystal_QuantumOS.md) §9).
