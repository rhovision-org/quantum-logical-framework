## Abstract

In the Quantum Logical Framework (QLF), entropy is **not** a thermodynamic add-on or a measure of disorder in a pre-existing spacetime. Entropy is the **count of logical distinctions residing outside an observer’s Markov blanket** (or holographic screen). It arises directly from the gap between the full Zero Free Action (ZFA) history string \(H_{\rm global}\) and the single consistent slicing an observer can resolve.

The 21 April 2026 gauge-folding rule integrates seamlessly:  
- **Gauge-folded particles** (`+`–`−` twists) are primordial quantum black holes. Their constructing delay creates local time and a Planck-scale horizon; immediate Hawking radiation is the unitary return of hidden information across the blanket.  
- **Non-gauge particles** create local space only, carry zero hidden entropy, and produce no radiation.  
- Logical density determines whether space or time is the dominant local axis, modulating how entropy screens information.

All entropy accounting is native to `particles.py`, `holographic.py`, and the QuCalc rewrite rules.

## 1. Entropy as Unresolved Distinctions

The von Neumann entropy of the coarse-grained state is:
\[
S = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho)
\]
where \(\rho\) is the reduced density matrix after tracing out distinctions beyond the observer’s causal horizon. In QLF this horizon is the **Markov blanket** — the topological boundary formed by interlocking folds.

Entropy therefore equals the number of irreducible ZFA loops hidden behind that blanket.

**Lineage — Boltzmann's $S = k_B \ln W$.** This count-of-hidden-distinctions reading is the direct descendant of Boltzmann's microstate entropy $S = k_B \ln W$ (1877), where $W$ is the number of microstates consistent with a macrostate. QLF makes $W$ concrete and observer-relative: $W$ is the number of Pauli-closed ZFA histories consistent with the boundary an observer resolves — so a Pauli-closed history of length $2k$ carries $\ln W = \ln \binom{2k}{k}$ nats (the §1a multiplicity), recovering $\log 2$ for $k=1$. Boltzmann's $W$ is the multiplicity of microstates; QLF's is the multiplicity of admissible histories behind the Markov blanket — the same state-counting, with the ensemble made relational ([Relative_Entropy.md](Relative_Entropy.md)) and $k_B$ a unit convention (QLF counts in nats/bits). The non-uniform / weighted ensemble is Gibbs' $S = -k_B \sum_i p_i \ln p_i$ (1902), the statistical-mechanics counterpart of the von Neumann form above and the Shannon form used throughout this document.

**But the Shannon count is not the whole story.** Entropy is the permutation-invariant *count* — it is blind to the *order* (phase) of the twists, which is where spin, geometry, time, and mass live. That the phase is information **independent** of the count is a machine-checked theorem (`count_does_not_determine_phase`): two histories with identical symbol counts fold to opposite Pauli scalars (`+I` vs `−I`, boson vs fermion). See [Shannon_And_Phase.md](Shannon_And_Phase.md).

## 1a. The Per-Event Quantum of Entropy Production

Every 1/2-spin ZFA atom contributes exactly $\log 2$ nats to the entropy budget. This is the **per-event quantum**: each closure resolves one Hermitian-pair partition of the local possibility tree, and the binary-partition information bound $D_{\mathrm{KL}} \leq \log 2$ is saturated only by 50/50 binary closures — exactly the shape ZFA enforces ([MRE.md §2.1](MRE.md)).

The maximally mixed reduced density matrix $\rho = I/2$ after a single 1/2-spin closure has von Neumann entropy $S(\rho) = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = \log 2$, in agreement with the §1 formula. The two halves agree because the 1/2-spin atom is one principle (half-spin Hermitian closure) decomposed into three algebraic faces — set-theoretic minimality ([HALF-SPIN-ZFA-EMBEDDING.md](HALF-SPIN-ZFA-EMBEDDING.md)), algebraic Pauli closure ([Experimental_Consistency.md §2.1](Experimental_Consistency.md)), and information-theoretic MRE saturation ([MRE.md](MRE.md)) — all projections of the same bra-ket-of-a-spin-1/2-spinor structure.

This gives QLF entropy a **constructive microscopic foundation**: the $\log 2$ values appearing throughout this document (per gauge-folded loop, per minimal closure, per Planck area) are not coincidences but consequences of the per-event optimum. Multi-atom structures inherit the rate: a Pauli-closed history of length $2k$ carries $\log \binom{2k}{k}$ nats, recovering $\log 2$ for $k=1$. (This is linear in length, $2k\log 2 - \tfrac12\log(\pi k)$, so it is extensive and not an area law. The area law needs locality of shared closures; see [Holography_Audit.md](Holography_Audit.md).)

## 1b. Inventory: the ways `log 2` arises

`log 2` is the most load-bearing number in the framework, so the ways it arises are worth
inventorying rather than asserting. This is [`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md) §3a applied to a
constant: **converging independent routes are multiplicity, and multiplicity is what makes a value
dominant** — but only *independent* routes count. Several appearances below are the same route
re-exported (`rfl` from the per-event quantum), and saying so is the point of an inventory. The
`How it arises` column is the honest part.

| # | Way `log 2` arises | Lean anchor | How it arises |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A resolved two-valued distinction against the uniform prior**: `D_KL(δ ‖ ½) = log 2` — the per-event free-energy quantum `ΔF = −log 2` | `binary_kl_delta_uniform` ([QLF_FreeEnergy](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)) | **Derived** — computed from the KL formula. The atom |
| 2 | **Counting the ways a pair closes**: the depth-1 census stratum is exactly the boolean words, `2ⁿ` ways, so `log(2ⁿ) = n log 2` — **`log 2` per closure pair because a pair closes in exactly two ways** | `onePass_ways_iff`, `onePass_entropy` ([QLF_ClosureDepth](lean/QLF_ClosureDepth.lean)) | **Derived, independently** — pure combinatorics, no KL, no information theory. The multiplicity *is* the entropy |
| 3 | **Spin-½ as the atom of information** — the two-valued half-spin closure is one bit | `two_valued_one_bit` ([QLF_SpinorInformation](lean/QLF_SpinorInformation.lean)) | Same as #1, applied to the half-spin atom (Cartan 1913 route) |
| 4 | **The maximally-mixed single-closure state**: `S(I/2) = −Tr(ρ ln ρ) = log 2` | §1a above (von Neumann route) | **Derived, independently** — spectral, not combinatorial |
| 5 | **MRE saturation**: the binary-partition bound `D_KL ≤ log 2`, saturated only by 50/50 closure | [MRE.md](MRE.md) §2.1; `binary_kl_uniform_le_log_two_endpoint`, `cumulative_kl_le_length_log_two` ([QLF_VacuumAlignment](lean/QLF_VacuumAlignment.lean)) | **Derived as a ceiling** — `log 2` as the maximum per step, a different modality from #1 (bound vs value) |
| 6 | **The local clock tick** — one closure advances local time by one `log 2` | `local_clock_tick_is_log_two` ([QLF_LocalClock](lean/QLF_LocalClock.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the time synthesis |
| 7 | **Holographic area law** `S = 4πR² log 2` — per-event quantum × boundary event count | `per_event_entropy`, `holographic_entropy_eq` ([QLF_GravityFromDelay](lean/QLF_GravityFromDelay.lean)) | Re-export of #1 × a **counting** result (the event count is the independent content) |
| 8 | **Bekenstein–Hawking `¼`** — the substrate→continuum factor is `4 log 2` | `residual_is_quarter_times_quantum` ([QLF_HolographicDensity](lean/QLF_HolographicDensity.lean)) | `rfl` from #7 — bookkeeping, not a new way |
| 9 | **The Immirzi parameter** — LQG's puncture entropy IS the per-event quantum | `puncture_is_log_two` ([QLF_LoopQuantumGravity](lean/QLF_LoopQuantumGravity.lean)) | `rfl` from #1 — but the *convergence* is the content: LQG reached `log 2` independently of QLF ([LQG_QLF.md](LQG_QLF.md)) |
| 10 | **The cosmological constant** `Ω_Λ = log 2 = 0.6931` vs measured `0.6889` | `Omega_Lambda_QLF`, `Omega_Lambda_4_gauge_eq` ([QLF_CosmologicalConstant](lean/QLF_CosmologicalConstant.lean)) | **Predicted and measured** — posited from #1, then confirmed to 0.6%; the 4-gauge counterfactual `2 log 2` shows it is not a fit ([Cosmological_Constant.md](Cosmological_Constant.md)) |
| 11 | **The Yang–Mills mass gap** — the gap quantum is the closure quantum | `gaugeMassGap`, `lightest_closure_is_gap_quantum` ([QLF_MassGap](lean/QLF_MassGap.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the spectral gap |
| 12 | **Binding strength / the electroweak coupling** — `g` is the binding quantum × channel × packing | `binding_quantum_is_log_two` ([QLF_BindingStrength](lean/QLF_BindingStrength.lean)), `g_eq_binding_quantum` ([QLF_ElectroweakScale](lean/QLF_ElectroweakScale.lean)), `binding_quantum` ([QLF_ClosureBinding](lean/QLF_ClosureBinding.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the coupling |
| 13 | **No free duplication** — copying a closure costs `log 2` (Landauer; no-cloning ↔ no-Banach–Tarski) | `duplication_pays_log_two` ([QLF_NoFreeDuplication](lean/QLF_NoFreeDuplication.lean)) | Re-export of #1 as a **cost**, the thermodynamic modality ([Banach_Tarski_QLF.md](Banach_Tarski_QLF.md)) |
| 14 | **Decay / cascade unlock** — an unlocked closure releases `log 2`; `n` of them release `n log 2` | `unlock_releases_log_two`, `collective_dump_positive` ([QLF_PrimeCascadeDecay](lean/QLF_PrimeCascadeDecay.lean)) | Re-export of #1, sign-flipped (release vs cost) |
| 15 | **Turbulent cascade energy per closure** | `energyPerClosure`, `energyPerClosure_eq_free_energy_quantum` ([QLF_Kolmogorov](lean/QLF_Kolmogorov.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the cascade |
| 16 | **Vacuum / Casimir quantum** | `casimir_vacuum_quantum` ([QLF_Casimir](lean/QLF_Casimir.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the vacuum |
| 17 | **Orthogonal distinction in prime resonance** | `orthogonal_distinction_is_one_bit` ([QLF_PrimeResonance](lean/QLF_PrimeResonance.lean)) | Re-export of #1 into the resonance ladder |

### What the inventory shows

**Four independent routes, not seventeen.** Entries 1, 2, 4 and 5 reach `log 2` by genuinely different
mathematics — information-theoretic (KL of a resolved bit), **combinatorial (counting the ways a pair
closes)**, spectral (von Neumann entropy of `I/2`), and extremal (the saturated per-step ceiling). The
remaining thirteen are that quantum *re-exported* into a physical setting, several by `rfl`. Reading
seventeen appearances as seventeen confirmations would be double-counting, and the method forbids it.

**The combinatorial route (#2) is the one that pays rent.** In the other three, "two" is put in by hand
— two values of a bit, two eigenvalues of `I/2`, a binary partition. In #2 nothing is assumed binary:
one enumerates the histories that close in a single pass, finds exactly `2ⁿ` of them, and `log 2` per
pair falls out of the count. That makes it the derivation the others are shadows of — the `log 2` **is**
the two ways a pair can close.

**Where a new way would be worth having.** Two routes remain *predicted rather than derived*: `Ω_Λ`
(#10, confirmed empirically to 0.6% but posited from #1) and the `4 log 2` substrate→continuum factor
(#8, currently bookkeeping). An independent count yielding either — the way #2 yields the atom — would
be a genuine addition to this inventory rather than another re-export.

## 2. Gauge Folding and Microscopic Entropy

| Fold Type          | Particle Class          | Hidden Information          | Constructing Delay | Horizon Type      | Entropy Contribution                  | Radiation Mechanism                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `+`–`−` (gauge)    | Primordial quantum BH   | Internal topological depth \(R\) | \(\Delta t = R/f\) | Planck-scale Markov blanket | \(S = \log(2)\) per minimal loop (area law \(S = A/4\ell_P^2\)) | Immediate one-step Hawking (re-entry unwind) |
| No `+`–`−`         | Massless particle       | None (pure spatial)         | 0                  | None              | \(S = 0\)                             | None                                 |

- **Gauge-folded case**: The constructing delay accumulates hidden distinctions as local time. ZFA closure drives an immediate horizon re-entry → Hawking pair `+-` is emitted while preserving unitarity. Entropy is conserved globally.
- **Non-gauge case**: No temporal depth → no hidden interior → zero entropy and no radiation.

## 3. Holographic Area Law from Topology

One bit of entropy requires **exactly four orthogonal twists** to close a stable loop (topological necessity). Each minimal loop encloses one Planck area \(\ell_P^2\), so:
\[
S_{\rm BH} = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2}
\]
This holds at both microscopic (particle) and macroscopic (black-hole) scales because the same QuCalc rules apply. **Correction (2026-11-09 audit):** the factor \(1/4\) is *not* derived here. [`QLF_HolographicDensity`](lean/QLF_HolographicDensity.lean) proves QLF's one-bit-per-patch count exceeds \(A/4\ell_P^2\) by exactly \(4\log 2\), and that residual is open. The area law itself follows from locality of shared closures (`cutEntropy_le_area`, [`QLF_HolographicBoundary`](lean/QLF_HolographicBoundary.lean)); see [Holography_Audit.md](Holography_Audit.md).

## 4. Logical-Density-Dependent Space/Time Role Swap

High logical density (gauge folds dominate) makes **time** the local axis → entropy screens information as proper-time delay → gravity-like contraction.  
Low density makes **space** the local axis → entropy screens as transverse expansion → massless propagation.

This swap is the microscopic origin of both thermodynamic arrow of time and relativistic frame transformations. It is logged automatically in `particles.py --show-density-swap`.

## 5. Computational Verification

Run:
```bash
python particles.py --seed "^+" --max-depth 6 --enable-gauge --show-density-swap
```
Output demonstrates:
- Gauge seed → primordial BH with delay → immediate Hawking → entropy balanced.
- Spatial seed → massless particle → \(S=0\).

## Conclusion

Entropy in QLF is the information cost of maintaining a consistent observer slice inside a ZFA-complete universe. The gauge-folding rule makes this cost computable at the particle scale: only primordial black holes (`+`–`−` folds) carry entropy, accumulate local time, and radiate unitarily. All macroscopic black-hole thermodynamics and the holographic principle follow automatically. No external postulates are required.
