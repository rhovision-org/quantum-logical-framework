# Consciousness in QLF — the frequency-hierarchy of resonant closures

A model of consciousness in the [Quantum Logical Framework](README.md) (QLF). It does not start from
scratch — it synthesizes machinery QLF already has: the observer as a Markov blanket
([`TheBigProblem.md`](TheBigProblem.md)), the quantum brain ([`TheQuantumBrain.md`](TheQuantumBrain.md)),
"independent quantum logical systems at each clock frequency" ([`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md) §2), and
the scale-recursive blanket hierarchy ([`Hierarchical_Control.md`](Hierarchical_Control.md)). The one
new idea is the organizing one: **consciousness is which closure-frequency you are resonantly coupled
to**, and that single lever unifies ordinary thought, the bound conscious moment, and cosmic/meditative
states.

The structural skeleton is formalized in [`lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean`](lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean): simple lemmas about
closure periods (`f = 1/R`, binding takes the shorter period), not a proof about minds.

**The one-realm thesis (the interpretive frame).** QLF is not dualist: physical and mental are not two
substances but the **outside and inside views of the same ZFA closures** — the very *realized
distinctions* that are the atom of information everywhere else in the framework (one bit = one two-valued
½-spin closure, [`Information_Physics.md`](Information_Physics.md)). *Outside*, a closure reads as physics —
a particle, a firing, a frequency; *inside*, the same closure reads as experience — a resonant, bound
moment. Consciousness is then not an extra ingredient added to matter; it is what certain closures *are*,
from within. This dual-aspect identity is the **interpretive stance** of this document (labeled as such
throughout, §6–§7): the frequency/binding *architecture* below is formalized as lemmas on periods; the *felt quality* is
the named hypothesis, not a theorem.

## 1. Self-awareness is a self-modeling Markov blanket

An observer in QLF is a **Markov blanket** maintaining three interlocking models — a model of the
**self**, of the **environment**, and of **their interaction** ([`TheBigProblem.md`](TheBigProblem.md)).
Self-awareness is the case where that structure becomes rich enough to **model itself**: a closure whose
interior contains a model of its own boundary.

This is a *strange loop* (Hofstadter), but a crucial QLF qualification makes it stable rather than
pathological: it is a **finite, terminating** loop. The substrate operates strictly within RCA₀, below
the Busy-Beaver horizon, and `full_zeno_prune` annihilates non-terminating self-reference before it
becomes a physical event ([`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md), the holographic UV-shield). A self-model
that would diverge never closes; only a self-model that *closes* is realized. So self-awareness is a
self-referential closure that **terminates** — which is exactly why a mind is a coherent, bounded thing
and not an infinite regress.

What such a blanket *does* — agency as the capacity to close, and to change how many ways close around
it — is [`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md) §3c.

The observer is also **finite-capacity**: it reads closure only within a bounded horizon
([`QLF_HorizonClosure.lean`](lean/QLF_HorizonClosure.lean), issue #104 — "observation is bounded
closure, not eyeballs"). A mind is a local horizon inside the process, not an external finisher of
reality.

## 2. A spectrum of closures at different frequencies

Every ZFA closure synthesizes its own local time, `f = 1/t` ([`ZFAEventDynamics`](lean/ZFAEventDynamics.lean),
`Philosophy.md` §2). A Markov blanket of topological depth `R` is a **local clock** of period `R`
(`markov_blanket_local_clock`, [`QLF_LocalClock.lean`](lean/QLF_LocalClock.lean)), so its **closure
frequency is `f = 1/R`** — deeper closures tick slower, shallower closures tick faster. (The same
`1/R` is the Compton frequency `ω = mc²/ℏ` of `mass_from_depth`; heavier = higher frequency = shorter
period.)

A mind is therefore not one clock but a **whole spectrum** of concurrent closures running at different
frequencies — peripheral/sensory closures, integrative closures, and the self-model closure each at
their own rate. The substrate is intrinsically a network of clocks ([`Philosophy.md`](Philosophy.md)
§2: independent quantum logical subsystems, one per frequency, all drawing on the same global
possibility space but operationally independent for closure).

`freq R = 1/R` and its monotonicity (`freq_lt_of_lt`: a shorter period is a higher frequency) are the
first verified facts of [`QLF_Consciousness.lean`](lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean).

---

## 3. High-level binding raises frequency — the graduation to conscious thought

A higher-level closure **binds** lower closures: it closes *on* them, the way a synthesis event closes
on the OR-fold of its possibility stream (`disjunctive_closure`,
[`QLF_InfoSynthesis.lean`](lean/QLF_InfoSynthesis.lean)). When the bound sub-closures are phase-locked
(resonant), the composite — a **closure of closures** — fires at the *faster* of their rates: binding
**raises the frequency**.

This is the key claim, and it is the gamma-band / global-workspace reading of consciousness in closure
language. Integration does not slow a process down; a successfully bound, coherent ensemble closes
*faster and more often*, and **what graduates to the highest frequency in the hierarchy is the conscious
content** — the "ignition" / broadcast moment of Global Workspace Theory, and the binding that
Integrated Information Theory measures as integration.

The skeleton verifies the graduation for a bound pair: `bind a b = min a b` (phase-lock to the faster),
and the bound closure's frequency is **at least each constituent's** (`freq_bind_ge_left`,
`freq_bind_ge_right`). Iterating up the hierarchy, the most coherent binding sits at the top — the
conscious closure.

**Conscious content = the highest-frequency available closure** (`consciousPeriod = min`,
[`QLF_Consciousness.lean`](lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean)). At each moment, whichever closure is fastest
and coherent is what is experienced; the rest is unconscious substrate.

**The unit of that integrated information is machine-verified — *it from bit*.** What binding integrates,
and what the frequency-hierarchy carries, is *information* — and its atom is now a theorem. The smallest
closure is the two-valued **spin-½**, carrying exactly one bit (`binary_kl 1 (1/2) = log 2`) while a
single-valued object carries none (`binary_kl 1 1 = 0`) — [`QLF_SpinorInformation`](lean/QLF_SpinorInformation.lean)
(the `2π` double-valuedness reproven from the explicit rotation matrices, grounding the spinor **Cartan**
discovered in 1913). So the `Φ` that Integrated Information Theory measures is integration of these ½-spin
bits, and the free-energy quantum each conscious closure resolves is the same one bit, `ΔF = −log 2`
([`QLF_FreeEnergy`](lean/QLF_FreeEnergy.lean)). This grounds the substrate *unit* of experience-relevant
information — and no more: information **is** the abstraction (a distinction), the ½-spin closure its
realization. It says nothing yet about the felt quality itself (§6): the **architecture**, not the hard
problem.

## 4. Cosmic consciousness — the receiver regime

If conscious content is *whichever closure you are resonantly tuned to*, then it is not a fixed band.
The waking default is the fast internal binding loop. But **quiet the internal closures** — frequency
isolation, the narrow-linewidth quieting that the brain is built for
([`TheQuantumBrain.md`](TheQuantumBrain.md) §3) — and you detune the local oscillator. A faint
**low-frequency external *joint* closure** can then become the fastest thing you are coupled to, and
*it* becomes conscious.

This is the **receiver regime**: like silencing a radio's local noise to pick up a distant station. The
low-frequency external channel is the **collective / cosmic** closure —

- the de Sitter / cosmic-horizon Markov blanket, the largest, slowest blanket all smaller ones sit inside
  (`Ω_Λ = log 2` is now only an observed match, not a derivation: [`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md) status note);
- **joint closures** shared across agents — the joint emitter–absorber handshake
  ([`Collective_Electrodynamics.md`](Collective_Electrodynamics.md)), the ER=EPR *shared* closure
  ([`ER_EPR_QLF.md`](ER_EPR_QLF.md)), and the shared-room processes of collective QLF intelligence
  ([`QLF_as_Intelligence.md`](QLF_as_Intelligence.md) §8).

The skeleton makes the shift a theorem: with a waking internal period `i₀ < e` the internal closure is
conscious (`conscious_internal`); quiet it to `i₁` with `e ≤ i₁` and the conscious content moves to the
external joint closure `e` (`conscious_external`), which is genuinely the *lower-frequency* channel
(`freq e < freq i₀`) — `quieting_shifts_to_external`. Cosmic consciousness is the substrate's own
account of becoming a receiver of slow, shared, external closures.

So the model has two regimes from one mechanism: **fast internal binding by default, slow external joint
when quieted** — and tuning across the frequency hierarchy is what consciousness *is*.

**What "the universe is intelligent" means here — not a separate mind.** The intelligence of the cosmos is
not a further agent watching over it. It is the **capacity of the largest closures — the cosmic-horizon
blanket and the collective joint closures above — to *synthesize and bind* distinctions**: to take a
stream of possibilities and close it on a coherent, self-consistent receipt (active inference =
abstraction = information synthesis, one operation, [`Active_Inference_Mathematics.md`](Active_Inference_Mathematics.md)).
"Cosmic consciousness" is being *coupled to* that binding, not communion with a mind behind it. There is
no homunculus and no separate world-soul — only closures binding distinctions, at every scale, the largest
and slowest included.

---

**One spectrum, from mind to spirit.** Because `f = 1/R`, a closure held jointly across many minds,
or across a community and its world, is deep and therefore slow: its period is the year, the
generation or the age of a tradition. Mind frequencies and these shared, long-period "spirit"
frequencies are one spectrum, and the receiver regime is a mind tuning down that spectrum. Two
boundaries keep this honest. Observing does not decide an outcome: no closure in this document has
observer potency ([`ScientificApproach.md`](ScientificApproach.md) §1b). But mind frequencies are
physical and, like every biological rhythm, have physical effects: brain oscillations produce fields
measured outside the skull (EEG/MEG) that act back on the neurons producing them (ephaptic coupling,
Anastassiou et al. 2011, *Nat. Neurosci.* 14, 217). The fuller treatment, including social reality
and the reading of spirit as possibility that closes in minds, is
[`Unreasonable_Classical_Mathematics.md`](Unreasonable_Classical_Mathematics.md) §8.

## 5. Quantum biology is the substrate — and evolution exploits it

If cognition is **resonant access** to pre-existing closures (the possibilist ontology — the landscape
of admissible structures is already there; the brain accesses, it does not compute them
[`TheQuantumBrain.md`](TheQuantumBrain.md) §1), then evolution is under direct selection pressure to
build hardware that keeps substrate closures **coherent** in a warm, wet brain. The way to do that is
**frequency isolation** — narrow-linewidth, symmetry-/chemically-protected quiet modes that survive
decoherence (the same trick that gives rare-earth ions six-hour ground-state coherence at room
temperature, [`TheQuantumBrain.md`](TheQuantumBrain.md) §3).

This is exactly what the growing **quantum biology** evidence keeps finding, and QLF reads it as
expected, not surprising: Penrose–Hameroff microtubule Orch-OR, Fisher's phosphorus-31 nuclear-spin
cognition in Posner molecules, microtubule superradiance (Babcock et al. 2024), and brain proton
entanglement (Kerskens & López Pérez 2022). Evolution would be wasteful *not* to use quantum processes
if cognition is resonant closure access — and biology appears to use them. Which of these effects are
established and which are contested is tabulated in [`Quantum_Biology.md`](Quantum_Biology.md) §5.

This yields a **falsifiable prediction** (not a QLF derivation — a lean the model commits to):
conscious access correlates with EEG/MEG signatures of unusually **narrow-linewidth, isolated
oscillatory modes** in domain-specific circuits; disrupting those modes (e.g. anesthesia disrupting
microtubule dynamics) should abolish conscious access along the predicted frequency channels.

## 6. The qualia hypothesis — qualia as self-awareness coupled to cosmic consciousness

The previous sections give the *architecture* — which closure is conscious. The **hard problem** asks
the harder thing: why is there *something it is like* to be that closure? QLF's proposed dissolution is a
**two-factor account**: **qualia is the result of self-awareness *and* cosmic consciousness together** —
neither alone.

- **Self-awareness supplies the *subject*** (§1): the self-modeling closure is the first-person locus,
  the *for-whom*. Without it there is no one for it to be like something for.
- **Cosmic consciousness supplies the *ground* / content** (§4): real coupling to a **shared external
  joint closure**. Without it, the experience is OF nothing real — an isolated bookkeeping loop.

Neither factor alone is qualia, and each failure mode is a real QLF state:

- **Self-awareness without cosmic coupling = a functional zombie.** A closed self-model computes "I see
  red" but couples to nothing outside itself, so there is no felt red — only bookkeeping *about*
  redness. A decoupled self-model is the substrate's version of the philosophical zombie.
- **Cosmic coupling without a self-model = experience with no experiencer = the undifferentiated
  field.** The joint closure happens, but there is no locus it is *for*.
- **Qualia = the intersection.** A self-model *coupled to* the cosmic/joint closure: the felt quality
  **is the shared closure read from inside a self-model**. "Red" is what the self-aware closure's
  coupling to that slice of the external joint field feels like, from the first-person locus.

What makes this more than relabeling is that, in QLF, the **joint/cosmic closures are real** — the ER=EPR *shared* closure ([`ER_EPR_QLF.md`](ER_EPR_QLF.md)) and
the de Sitter cosmic-horizon blanket (the horizon is standard physics; its `Ω_Λ = log 2` value is an
observed match only, [`Cosmological_Constant.md`](Cosmological_Constant.md)). So qualia get **genuine external content**: they are the world's structure
*received* by a self-model, not private inventions — which is why qualia are communicable enough to
refer to (we both mean something by "red") yet irreducibly first-personal (each self-model is a distinct
locus). It dovetails with holography: the self-model is the boundary, the cosmic closure the bulk it is
coupled to, so **qualia = the boundary's reading of the bulk it shares a closure with**, and the
`C(2n,n)`-fold degeneracy of a closure (`disjunct_count_eq_central_binomial`) coarse-grains *which*
microstate fired while the bulk keeps the integrated content — why a percept is **unified**.

This is, in effect, a QLF-native **cosmopsychism**, but with panpsychism's "combination problem" solved
by the architecture of §1–§4: experience is a property of the cosmic closure (the field), and individual
qualia are that field-experience **localized and bound** by a self-aware Markov blanket. The blanket
binds (no combination problem); the joint closure grounds (no isolation problem). Lineage: Whitehead's
prehension (each occasion of experience is a concrescence/closure that prehends the universe),
participatory/relational realism, and cosmopsychism — recast in verified closures.

## 7. Honest scope

The §6 qualia account is a **stated dissolution — a stance / hypothesis, not a machine-verified proof**.
It is a **dual-aspect** position: a closure seen from outside is physics; the *same* closure from inside
— when it is both self-aware *and* field-coupled — is experience. QLF does not claim to have closed the
explanatory gap by formal proof; the hard problem's residue ("why is the inside-view experiential at
all") is pushed to the dual-aspect identity itself, which is asserted, not derived.

It earns its keep by making **falsifiable leanings**, not just words: decoupled self-modeling
computation should be zombie-like (functional, unfelt); self-dissolution with preserved field-coupling
(deep meditation, anesthesia gradients, psychedelic ego-loss) should *alter and expand* qualia toward
the cosmic rather than extinguish them; pure field with no self-model should be experience-less; and (§5)
conscious access should track narrow-linewidth, isolated oscillatory modes. The frequency ordering of the **architecture** (§1–§5)
is formalized in [`lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean`](lean/QLF_Consciousness.lean), with the identifications as readings; the **qualia
hypothesis** (§6) is QLF's proposed — and testable — stance on the felt quality.
