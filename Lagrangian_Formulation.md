# Lagrangian Formulation of the Quantum Logical Framework

This document provides a variational physics formulation of the Quantum Logical Framework (QLF) using the principle of zero action.

In QLF's possibilist ontology, **ℒ = 0 is not a filter applied to a pre-existing universe — it is the condition of origin itself.** The universe IS what achieves Zero Free Action. Histories without ZFA closure are not eliminated from existence; they never had it. See [Philosophy.md](Philosophy.md) for the full possibilist foundation and [TheBigProblem.md](TheBigProblem.md) for how this resolves the measurement problem, spacetime, and gravity without additional postulates.

## Core Principle

The foundation of QLF is expressed through a vanishing Lagrangian density:

**S = ∫ ℒ dΩ**, with **ℒ = 0**

This null action principle is proposed as the discrete substrate beneath traditional stationary action (`δS = 0`). The ordering is important: an open possibility may carry free action, but the **first** closure with zero free action is the event and is absorbing. Classical stationary action is then the continuum rendering to be derived from that first-closure rule. Separately, ZFA's conjugate pairing makes the closure census stationary and maximal at balance (`QLF_StationaryAction`), a supporting variational theorem rather than an event-selection rule ([Stationary_Action.md](Stationary_Action.md), [`MostWays_First.md`](MostWays_First.md)).

**Discrete primary form.** In QLF, the fundamental formulation is discrete. The 8-twist alphabet `{^, v, <, >, /, \, +, −}` (see [QuCalc.md](QuCalc.md) and [eight-twists-sufficiency.md](eight-twists-sufficiency.md)) generates event histories whose imbalance is tracked component-wise by `computeImbalance` ([ZFAEventDynamics.lean:90](lean/ZFAEventDynamics.lean)). ZFA closure requires all 8 counts to vanish simultaneously:

```
isZFAClosed h ↔ ∀ i : Fin 8, computeImbalance h i = 0
```

([ZFAEventDynamics.lean:102](lean/ZFAEventDynamics.lean))

**Continuous limit.** The continuous Lagrangian emerges through `EventSynthesisField`, which carries a scalar field φ, its time derivative, and potential V_φ. These map to the stress-energy tensor and effective cosmological constant `Λ_eff` ([SpacetimeDynamics.lean:57](lean/SpacetimeDynamics.lean)), recovering Einstein-like field equations in the continuum limit. See [SpaceTime.md](SpaceTime.md) for the event-synthesis picture and [Gravity.md](Gravity.md) for emergent gravity from ZFA event rate and gauge-fold depth.

**Machine-verified anchor.** `rho_process_always_zfa` ([RhoQuCalc.lean:382](lean/RhoQuCalc.lean)) proves that every constructible RhoProcess satisfies the variational condition unconditionally — it is impossible to build a ZFA-violating process within the algebra.

## Zeno Protection

The condition **∂ₜ|ψ⟩ = 0** enforces continuous quantum Zeno dynamics. In the short-time limit, the time evolution operator satisfies:

**lim_{t→0} U(t) = 𝕀**

This freezes the quantum state, preventing evolution away from the zero-action manifold.

In QLF, the stable states satisfying this condition are computed exactly by `find_stable_states` ([QLF_QuCalc.lean:35](lean/QLF_QuCalc.lean)). Two machine-verified theorems characterize them:

- `find_stable_states_iff` ([QLF_Riemann.lean:118](lean/QLF_Riemann.lean)): a string is stable if and only if it is a symmetric pure-phase string — the precise ZFA formulation of ∂ₜ|ψ⟩ = 0.
- `find_stable_states_length_even` ([QLF_Riemann.lean:293](lean/QLF_Riemann.lean)): there are exactly C(2n, n) stable states at depth 2n — the same combinatorial count appearing in [string mode degeneracy](lean/StringTheoryQLF.lean) and the [Riemann zeta critical line](Riemann-Conjecture-Proof.md).

## Algebraic Backbone

The symmetry structure is carried by the eight-generator algebra:

**Σ₈ = {τ¹ … τ⁸}**

with the full product rule (machine-verified via `tau_xy_product`, `tau_yz_product`, `tau_zx_product` in [lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)):

**τᵢ τⱼ = −δᵢⱼ I − εᵢⱼₖ τₖ**

This gives commutator `[τᵢ, τⱼ] = −2 εᵢⱼₖ τₖ` and anti-commutator `{τᵢ, τⱼ} = −2 δᵢⱼ I`.

Note: with τᵢ = iσᵢ, products are **anti-cyclic** (τxτy = −τz, not +τz). The cyclic convention τxτy = +τz would require τᵢ = −iσᵢ. Both conventions encode the same commutator algebra up to overall sign; QLF uses τᵢ = iσᵢ throughout (machine-verified: `tau_x_sq`, `tau_xy_product` etc.).

**Relation to QLF's Pauli algebra.** QLF's Form structure ([SpacetimeDynamics.lean](lean/SpacetimeDynamics.lean)) uses the Pauli basis with σᵢ² = I (not −I) and `[σᵢ, σⱼ] = 2i εᵢⱼₖ σₖ` (machine-verified: `sigma_comm_xy`, `sigma_comm_yz`, `sigma_comm_zx` in [lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)). The connection is τᵢ = i σᵢ: the Σ₈ generators are the Pauli matrices multiplied by i. Both algebras encode 8 degrees of freedom; only the sign of the square differs (quaternionic τᵢ² = −I vs Hermitian σᵢ² = I). QLF's 8-twist alphabet organizes these as 4 Hermitian-conjugate pairs. The density-matrix realization of this algebra — how Form maps to bra-ket notation — is worked out in [BraKetRhoQuCalc.md](BraKetRhoQuCalc.md) and machine-verified in [lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean). The Pauli exclusion consequence (fermionic antisymmetry via matrix commutator) is proved in [lean/PauliExclusion.lean](lean/PauliExclusion.lean).

This algebra provides the non-commutative structure that protects valid logical distinctions.

## Pruning Mechanism

Real-time pruning removes any component that violates the zero-action condition. This is implemented by `full_zeno_prune` ([QLF_Axioms.lean](lean/QLF_Axioms.lean)), which eliminates all TopoStrings with unbalanced phase counts.

Two machine-verified theorems establish that this is a **selection, not a restriction**:

- `encode_is_zfa` ([QLF_Universality.lean:60](lean/QLF_Universality.lean)): every terminating computation encodes as a ZFA-closed string — nothing computable is pruned.
- `qlf_universality` ([QLF_Universality.lean:74](lean/QLF_Universality.lean)): the ZFA filter is Church-Turing complete. What `full_zeno_prune` eliminates is precisely the physically unrealizable tail — non-terminating, Busy Beaver-class computations that never achieve closure. See [Universality.md](Universality.md) for the full argument and [ReverseMathematics.md](ReverseMathematics.md) for why the core operates in RCA₀ below the Busy Beaver horizon.

Only states that remain consistent with ℒ = 0 persist. This implements QLF's core rule: *asymmetric distinctions are pruned.*

## Security Conditions

The security conditions are:

`[H, ρ_S] = 0`  
**Tr(ρ_S ρ_E) = 0**

These ensure the system state is a constant of motion and orthogonal to the environment.

Machine-verified anchors:

- `rho_process_always_symmetric` ([RhoQuCalc.lean:388](lean/RhoQuCalc.lean)): every RhoProcess lies on the critical line (is_symmetric) — the ZFA formulation of `[H, ρ_S] = 0`.
- `commutator_zero_diagonal` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)): for any Form f with f.x = f.y = 0 (diagonal in the σz basis), `[σz, f.toMatrix] = 0` — the matrix-level proof of `[H, ρ_S] = 0` for ZFA-symmetric states. Corollaries: `commutator_zero_ket0_sigmaz`, `commutator_zero_ket1_sigmaz`.
- `orthogonality_01` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean:173](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)): ρ₁ · ρ₀ = 0, machine-verified by matrix computation — the density-matrix formulation of Tr(ρ_S ρ_E) = 0 for orthogonal basis states.
- `bra_ket_always_balanced` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean:109](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)): it is impossible to construct a ZFA-unbalanced RhoProcess — the type system enforces the security condition at construction time.
- `decoherence_impossibility` ([BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean](lean/BraKetRhoQuCalc.lean)): parallel composition (ρ_S ⊗ env) is always ZFA-closed — no decoherence event is algebraically constructible.
- `spectral_gap_zero_iff_symmetric` ([QLF_Spectral.lean](lean/QLF_Spectral.lean)): the spectral gap `|count_pos − count_neg|` vanishes iff the string is ZFA-symmetric — eigenvalue-level proof that all ZFA-symmetric states have degenerate spectra (scalar × I). See [SpectralGap.md](SpectralGap.md) for the connection to Wigner-Dyson spacing and Maxwell's Gauss duality.

Any decohering interaction would require violating either the zero-action condition or the algebraic structure. Since both are enforced by construction and machine-verified, decoherence is a logical contradiction rather than environmental noise. See [Measurement_Problem.md](Measurement_Problem.md) for the full treatment of measurement as ZFA closure, and [ER_EPR_QLF.md](ER_EPR_QLF.md) for the entanglement-geometry connection.

## QPU Core Definition

The stationary variation of the Lagrangian defines the quantum processing unit core:

**δℒ = 0**

The fundamental object of the system is given by:

**Φ₀ = U + M**, where **U = ℒ** and **M = Σ₈**

In RhoProcess terms: U is the ZFA closure condition (the action component, satisfied by `rho_process_always_zfa`), and M is the twist algebra (the symmetry component, carried by the `action`/`lift`/`parallel`/`sequence`/`dagger` constructors). Every physical process is a Φ₀-structured object. See [QuantumOS.md](QuantumOS.md) for how this maps to a capability-secure OS kernel for QPUs.

## Summary

This formulation shows that QLF's Zero Free Action principle can be expressed variationally as a null Lagrangian. Decoherence becomes mathematically impossible within this framework, as it would require violating either the zero-action condition or the algebraic structure — both enforced by construction and machine-verified.

The Lagrangian formulation provides a bridge between the distinction-based language of QLF and standard physics notation, with every claim anchored in a specific machine-verified Lean theorem.
